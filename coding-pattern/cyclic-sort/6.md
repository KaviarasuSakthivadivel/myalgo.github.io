# 6. Find the Corrupt Pair

We are given an unsorted array containing ‘n’ numbers taken from the range 1 to ‘n’. The array originally contained all the numbers from 1 to ‘n’, but due to a data error, one of the numbers got duplicated which also resulted in one number going missing. Find both these numbers.

    Input: [3, 1, 2, 5, 2]
    Output: [2, 4]
    Explanation: '2' is duplicated and '4' is missing.

## Thoughts
Do cyclic sort which will place each number at its correct index. 

Once we are done with the cyclic sort, we will iterate through the array to find the number that is not at the correct index. Since only one number got corrupted, the number at the wrong index is the duplicated number and the index itself represents the missing number.

## Solution

```java
package io.educative.cylicsort;

import java.util.Arrays;

public class CorruptPair {
    public static int[] findNumbers(int[] nums) {
        // Do cylic sort
        int i = 0;
        while(i < nums.length) {
            if(nums[i] != nums[nums[i] - 1]) {
                swap(nums, i, nums[i] - 1);
            } else {
                i++;
            }
        }

        for(i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if(nums[i] != i + 1) {
                return new int[]{ nums[i], i + 1};
            }
        }
        return new int[]{-1, -1};
    }

    private static void swap(int[] arr, int i, int j) {
        int temp = arr[i];
        arr[i] = arr[j];
        arr[j] = temp;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(findNumbers(new int[]{3, 1, 2, 5, 2})));
    }
}
```
