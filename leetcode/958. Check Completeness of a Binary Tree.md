Given the `root` of a binary tree, determine if it is a _complete binary tree_.

In a **[complete binary tree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree#Types_of_binary_trees)**, every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between `1` and `2h` nodes inclusive at the last level `h`.

**Input:** root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** Every level before the last is full (ie. levels with node-values {1} and {2, 3}), and all nodes in the last level ({4, 5, 6}) are as far left as possible.

### Approach 1: Breadth First Search

#### Intuition

By analyzing the definition, we can see that a binary tree is complete if there is no node to the right of the first `null` node and no node at a greater level than the first `null` node.

It means that if we traverse the tree level by level from left to right and we come across a `null` node, all subsequent nodes in this traversal should be `null` as well (should not exist). The level-order traversal array of a complete binary tree will never have a `null` node in between non-null nodes.

Breadth-first search (BFS) traversal can be used to perform level-wise traversal. BFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching a graph. It traverses in a level-wise manner, i.e., all the nodes at the present level (say `l`) are explored before moving on to the nodes at the next level (`l + 1`), where a level's number is the distance from a starting node. BFS is implemented with a queue.

If you are not familiar with BFS traversal, we suggest you read our [Leetcode Explore Card](https://leetcode.com/explore/featured/card/graph/620/breadth-first-search-in-graph/).

We begin with the `root` node. We return `true` if `root` is `null` because the empty tree fits the definition of a complete binary tree. Otherwise, we initialize a boolean variable called `nullNodeFound` to keep track of whether or not we have seen a `null` node. We set it to `false` at the start.

We start a BFS traversal pushing `root` in the BFS queue. While the BFS queue is not empty, we fetch the front `node` in the queue. If `node == null`, we mark `nullNodeFound = true`. Otherwise, if `node != null`, we check if we have already visited a `null` node. If we've previously visited a `null` node and `node != null`, the given tree isn't a complete binary tree as we are encountering a node after visiting a `null` node. We return `false` in such a case.

If we haven't yet visited a `null` node and `node != null`, we push `node.left` and then `node.right` to iterate from left to right at each level.

We return `true` if we can traverse the entire tree without encountering a non-null node after a `null` node.

#### Algorithm

1. There is no node in the given tree if the `root` node is `null`. We return `true`.
2. Create a boolean variable `nullNodeFound` to track whether or not a `null` node has been visited yet. We initialize it to `false`.
3. Intiailize a `TreeNode` queue `q` and push `root` into it.
4. While the queue is not empty:
    - Dequeue the first element `node` from the queue.
    - If `node == null`, mark `nullNodeFound = true`.
    - Otherwise, if `node` is not `null`, we check to see if we have previously visited a `null` node. If `nullNodeFound == true`, it means we have `node` which is not `null` after visiting a `null` node. As a result, we return `false` in such a case. Otherwise, if we have not visited a `null` node yet, we push `node.left` and then `node.right` into the queue.
5. We are able to traverse the entire tree without seeing a non-null node after a `null` node, we return `true`.

### Approach 2: Depth First Search

#### Intuition

A complete binary tree has an interesting property that we can use to find the children and parents of any node.

A complete binary tree can be represented with an array. If the index of a node in the array is `i`, the element at index `2i + 1` will be its `left` child and the element at index `2i + 2` will be its `right` child. If there are a total of `n` nodes in a complete binary tree, it can be represented with an array where the nodes are ordered level by level, left to right. As we saw in the previous approach, there will be no `null` node between two non-null nodes.

Let's take a look at the following array representation of a complete binary tree:


![[958-2.png]]

This property can be used to solve the problem.

Starting with the root node and assigning it an index of `0`, we can use the above property to assign indices to all the other nodes in the tree. Let `n` represent the total number of nodes in the tree. As we saw above, the assigned index of every node must be smaller than or equal to `n` for the given tree to form a complete binary tree.

If the `index` of a `node` is greater or equal to `n`, it means a node is missing from the first `n` indices. In such a case, the tree is not a complete binary tree. The array representation of such a binary tree will have at least one `null` node in between non-null nodes.

If `index < n`, we proceed to its children. We use index as `2 * index + 1` for the left child `node.left` and `2 * index + 2` for the right child. Similarly, we determine whether or not the index of the both the children is greater than `n` or not.

Let's take a look at some visual examples:

![[958-3.png]]

For every `node`, we can recursively iterate over its `left` and `right` children and verify if the assigned indices are smaller than `n`. We can use a depth-first search to perform this recursive traversal.

In DFS, we use a recursive function to explore nodes as far as possible along each branch. Upon reaching the end of a branch, we backtrack to the previous node and continue exploring the next branches.

Once we encounter an unvisited node, we will take one of its neighbor nodes (if exists) as the next node on this branch. Recursively call the function to take the next node as the 'starting node' and solve the subproblem.

If you are new to Depth First Search, please see our [Leetcode Explore Card](https://leetcode.com/explore/featured/card/graph/619/depth-first-search-in-graph/3882/) for more information on it!

First, we do a simple DFS to determine the number of nodes `n`.

Next, we start another DFS with `root` as `node` and assigning an index of `0` to it. If `node == null`, we have an empty subtree of `node`. For this case, we return `true`. Otherwise, we examine whether `index >= n`. If the index is greater or equal to `n`, we return `false`. Otherwise, we call dfs recursively for the left and right subtrees to see if any node in either subtree violates the complete binary tree property. To perform this recursion, we use `dfs(node->left, 2 * index + 1, n) && dfs(node->right, 2 * index + 2, n)`.


```java
class Solution {

    private int countNodes(TreeNode root) {
        if(root == null) {
            return 0;
        }

        return 1 + countNodes(root.left) + countNodes(root.right);
    }

    private boolean dfs(TreeNode root, int index, int n) {
        if(root == null) {
            return true;
        }

        if(index >= n) {
            return false;
        }

        return dfs(root.left, 2 * index + 1, n) && dfs(root.right, 2 * index + 2, n);
    }
    
    public boolean isCompleteTree(TreeNode root) {
        return dfs(root, 0, countNodes(root));
    }
    
    public boolean isCompleteTreeUsingBFS(TreeNode root) {
        if(root == null) {
            return true;
        }
        boolean nullNodeFound = false;

        Queue<TreeNode> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        queue.add(root);

        while(!queue.isEmpty()) {
            TreeNode node = queue.poll();

            if(node == null) {
                nullNodeFound = true;
            } else {
                if(nullNodeFound) {
                    return false;
                }

                queue.add(node.left);
                queue.add(node.right);
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
