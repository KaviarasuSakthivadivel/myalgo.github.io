Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _the **maximum width** of the given tree_.

The **maximum width** of a tree is the maximum **width** among all levels.

The **width** of one level is defined as the length between the end-nodes (the leftmost and rightmost non-null nodes), where the null nodes between the end-nodes that would be present in a complete binary tree extending down to that level are also counted into the length calculation.

It is **guaranteed** that the answer will in the range of a **32-bit** signed integer.

**Input:** root = [1,3,2,5,3,null,9]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** The maximum width exists in the third level with length 4 (5,3,null,9).

## Solution

![[662_full_binary_tree.png]]

With the above indexing schema, we manage to assign a unique index for each node on the same level, and in addition there is no _gap_ among all the indices if it is a full binary tree.

For a non-full binary tree, the relationship between the indices of a parent and its child node still holds.

Now that we have an indexing schema, all we need to do is to assign an index for each node in the tree.  
Once it is done, we can calculate the _width_ for each level, and finally we could return the maximal value among them as the solution.

Voila. This is the key insight to solve the problem. With this hint, we believe that one could definitely come up with some solutions.

As a spoiler alert, we will cover how to implement different solutions with BFS and DFS traversal strategies in the remaining sections.

#### Approach 1: BFS Traversal

**Intuition**

Naturally, one might resort to the BFS traversal.  
After all, the width is measured among the nodes on the same level.  
So let us get down to the BFS traversal first.

There are several ways to implement the BFS traversal. Almost all of them share a common point, _i.e._ using the `queue` data structure to maintain the order of visits.

In brief, we push the nodes into the queue level by level.  
As a result, the priorities of visiting would roll out from top to down and from left to right, due to the FIFO (First-In First-Out) principle of the queue data structure, _i.e._ the element that enters the queue first would exit first as well.

In the above graph, we show an example of BFS traversal on a full binary tree where we indicate the _global_ order of visiting along with each node.

**Algorithm**

Here are a few steps to implement a solution with the BFS traversal.

- First of all, we create a `queue` data structure, which would be used to hold elements of tuple as `(node, col_index)`, where the `node` is the tree node and the `col_index` is the corresponding index that is assigned to the node based on our indexing schema.  
    Also, we define a global variable called `max_width` which holds the maximal width that we've seen so far.
    
- Then we append the root node along with its index 0, to kick off the BFS traversal.
    
- The BFS traversal is basically an iteration over the elements of queue. We visit the nodes _level by level_ until there are no more elements in the queue.
    
    - At the end of each level, we use the indices of the first and the last elements on the same level, in order to obtain the width of the level.
- At the end of BFS traversal, we then return the maximal width that we've seen over all levels.



```java
class Solution {
    public int widthOfBinaryTree(TreeNode root) {
        LinkedList<Pair<TreeNode, Integer>> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        queue.offer(new Pair<>(root, 0));
        
        int maxWidth = 0;
        
        while(!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int levelNo = queue.size();
            Pair<TreeNode, Integer> head = queue.getFirst();
            Pair<TreeNode, Integer> tail = null;
            for(int i = 0; i < levelNo; i++) {
                tail = queue.removeFirst();
                TreeNode node = tail.getKey();
                if(node.left != null) {
                    queue.offer(new Pair<>(node.left, 2 * tail.getValue()));
                }
                
                if(node.right != null) {
                    queue.offer(new Pair<>(node.right, 2 * tail.getValue() + 1));
                }
            }
            
            maxWidth = Math.max(maxWidth, tail.getValue() - head.getValue() + 1);
        }
        return maxWidth;
    }
}
