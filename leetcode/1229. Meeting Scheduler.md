Given the availability time slots arrays `slots1` and `slots2` of two people and a meeting duration `duration`, return the **earliest time slot** that works for both of them and is of duration `duration`.

If there is no common time slot that satisfies the requirements, return an **empty array**.

The format of a time slot is an array of two elements `[start, end]` representing an inclusive time range from `start` to `end`.

It is guaranteed that no two availability slots of the same person intersect with each other. That is, for any two time slots `[start1, end1]` and `[start2, end2]` of the same person, either `start1 > end2` or `start2 > end1`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** slots1 = [[10,50],[60,120],[140,210]], slots2 = [[0,15],[60,70]], duration = 8
**Output:** [60,68]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** slots1 = [[10,50],[60,120],[140,210]], slots2 = [[0,15],[60,70]], duration = 12
**Output:** []

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= slots1.length, slots2.length <= 104`
- `slots1[i].length, slots2[i].length == 2`
- `slots1[i][0] < slots1[i][1]`
- `slots2[i][0] < slots2[i][1]`
- `0 <= slots1[i][j], slots2[i][j] <= 109`
- `1 <= duration <= 106`

## Solution

#### Overview

To find the earliest time slot that works for both the people, the most straightforward approach would be to examine all possible time slots for them. To improve it, we can either sort both input arrays and apply two pointers, or we can use a heap for sorting the time slots and find the earliest overlapping time slot. We will cover both of these approaches in this article.

#### Approach 1: Two pointers

**Intuition**

![[1129-img1.png]]

_Figure 1. The common slot between two slots._

We want to sort both `slots1` and `slots2` by the start time first, then initialize two pointers, each of which points to the beginning of the two arrays. From there, we will compare the two slots, and move one pointer at a time if the common slot is smaller than `duration`.

> Note that sorting by the start time vs the end time is the same, this is because, if a time slot starts earlier, it will end earlier. Remember that for both people, there're no overlapping time slots

Here comes the question: how do we decide which pointer should be incremented?

The answer is: we will always move the one that ends earlier. Assuming that we are comparing `slots1[i]` and `slots2[j]` and `slots1[i][1] > slots2[j][1]`, we would always choose to move the pointer `j`. The reason is that, as both slots are sorted, if `slots1[i][1] > slots2[j][1]`, we know `slots1[i+1][0] > slots2[j][1]` so that there will be no intersection between `slots1[i+1]` and `slots2[j]`.

_Figure 2. Always move the one that ends earlier._

**Algorithm**

- Sort both `slots1` and `slots2` by the start time.
- Initialize two pointers, `pointer1` and `pointer2`, pointing to the beginning of `slots1` and the beginning of `slots2` respectively.
- Iterate until `pointer1` reaches the end of `slots1` or `pointer2` reaches the end of `slots2`:
    - Find the common slot of `slots1[pointer1]` and `slots2[pointer2]`.
    - If the common slot is greater than or equal to `duration`, return the result.
    - Else, find the slot that ends earlier and move the pointer.
- If no common slot is found, return an empty array.

### Code

```java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> minAvailableDuration(int[][] slots1, int[][] slots2, int duration) {
        Arrays.sort(slots1, (a, b) -> a[0] - b[0]);
        Arrays.sort(slots2, (a, b) -> a[0] - b[0]);

        int p1 = 0, p2 = 0, N = slots1.length, M = slots2.length;

        while(p1 < N && p2 < M) {
            int intersectLeft = Math.max(slots1[p1][0], slots2[p2][0]);
            int intersectRight = Math.min(slots1[p1][1], slots2[p2][1]);

            if(intersectRight - intersectLeft >= duration) {
                return new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(intersectLeft, intersectLeft + duration));
            }

            if(slots1[p1][1] < slots2[p2][1]) {
                p1++;
            } else {
                p2++;
            }
        }

        return Collections.emptyList();
    }
}
```

#### Approach 2: Heap

**Intuition**

Another approach of systematically selecting slots and comparing them is using a heap. We would initialize a heap `timeslots` and push all of the time slots into it.

The key idea here is that **we only need one heap**. That is, we can put the time slots for _both_ people into the same heap, and then if we find a common time slot, we know that the two-time slots _couldn't possibly be for the same person_. Before reading the justification for this, have a think for yourself about why we can draw such a bold conclusion.

The problem description states that the time slots for a single person _do not overlap_. This means that if, for example, we have the time slots `[10, 15]` and `[14, 20]`, then we _know_ that these time slots _cannot be for the same person_. Otherwise, we would have a contradiction. So, given that a common time slot has to overlap, the two slots have to be from different people.

A heap returns the smallest items first. Because of this time slots we remove from the heap are sorted by the start time. Taking advantage of this, we can then compare the time slots in the order of time.

_Figure 3. Compare the popped time slot and the top element in the heap._

**Algorithm**

- Initialize a heap `timeslots` and push time slots that last longer than `duration` into it.
- Iterate until there's only one time slot remaining in `timeslots`:
    - Pop the first time slot `[start1, end1]` from `timeslots`.
    - Retrieve the next time slot `[start2, end2]`, which is the current top element in `timeslots`.
    - If we find `end1 >= start2 + duration`, because `start1 <= start2`, the common slot is longer than `duration` and we can return it.
- If we don't find the common slot that is longer than `duration`, return an empty array.

```java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> minAvailableDuration(int[][] slots1, int[][] slots2, int duration) {
        PriorityQueue<int[]> timeslots = new PriorityQueue<>((slot1, slot2) -> slot1[0] - slot2[0]);

        for (int[] slot: slots1) {
            if (slot[1] - slot[0] >= duration) timeslots.offer(slot);
        }
        for (int[] slot: slots2) {
            if (slot[1] - slot[0] >= duration) timeslots.offer(slot);
        }

        while (timeslots.size() > 1) {
            int[] slot1 = timeslots.poll();
            int[] slot2 = timeslots.peek();
            if (slot1[1] >= slot2[0] + duration) {
                return new ArrayList<Integer>(Arrays.asList(slot2[0], slot2[0] + duration));
            }
        }
        return new ArrayList<Integer>();
    }
}
```
