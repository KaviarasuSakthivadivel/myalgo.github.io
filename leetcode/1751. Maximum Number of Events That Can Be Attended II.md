You are given an array of `events` where `events[i] = [startDayi, endDayi, valuei]`. The `ith` event starts at `startDayi` and ends at `endDayi`, and if you attend this event, you will receive a value of `valuei`. You are also given an integer `k` which represents the maximum number of events you can attend.

You can only attend one event at a time. If you choose to attend an event, you must attend the **entire** event. Note that the end day is **inclusive**: that is, you cannot attend two events where one of them starts and the other ends on the same day.

Return _the **maximum sum** of values that you can receive by attending events._

**Input:** events = [[1,2,4],[3,4,3],[2,3,1]], k = 2
**Output:** 7
**Explanation:** Choose the green events, 0 and 1 (0-indexed) for a total value of 4 + 3 = 7.

**Input:** events = [[1,2,4],[3,4,3],[2,3,10]], k = 2
**Output:** 10
**Explanation:** Choose event 2 for a total value of 10.
Notice that you cannot attend any other event as they overlap, and that you do **not** have to attend k events.

## Solution

### Overview

We can only attend an event if the start day of it is greater than the end day of the previously attended event. This implies that we should sort events by their start time. As shown in the following figure, we sort `events = [[1,2,4],[3,4,3],[2,3,1],[4,6,5],[2,4,8]]` according to the start time of each event.

Let's start with the original `dfs(cur_index = 0, count = 0)`, as shown in the figure, we have two options for event 0:

- attend it and gain a value of `events[0][2]`. As we are not using binary search to locate the nearest available event, we would attempt attending the next event and gain a value of `dfs(1, 1)`. Therefore, the total value gained would be `events[0][2] + dfs(1, 1)`.
- skip it and gain a value of `dfs(1, 0)`

![[1751_1.png]]

However, `dfs(0, 0) = max(events[0][2] + dfs(1, 1), dfs(1, 0))` creates a problem, as we mentioned earlier: the start time of event 1 is not greater than the end time of event 0, so we cannot attend event 1 after attending event 0. However, the algorithm does not verify this condition and will continue to recursively calculate `dfs(1, 1)`, `dfs(2, 2)`, and so on, leading to incorrect answers.

![[1751_2.png]]

Therefore, we need to modify the `dfs(cur_index, count)` function by adding an extra parameter called `prev_ending_time`, which represents the end time of the previous event we attended.
![[1751_3.png]]

With the added parameter `prev_ending_time`, the function `dfs(cur_index = 1, count, prev_ending_time = 2)` ensures that we only consider valid events that can be attended after the previous event ends. This is accomplished by checking if `prev_ending_time` is smaller than the start time of the next event. If it is not, we skip the calculation of `dfs(cur_index + 1, count + 1, events[cur_index][1])` and only consider the option of skipping the current event.

> Let's define the complete function `dfs(cur_index, count, prev_ending_time)` as the maximum value obtained by attending a maximum of `count` events in the range `events[cur_index ~ n - 1]`, where the previously attended event ends at `prev_ending_time`.

    }
    
    private int dfs(int curIndex, int count, int prevEndingTime, int[][] events, int k) {
        if (curIndex == events.length || count == k) {
            return 0;
        }

            return dfs(curIndex + 1, count, prevEndingTime, events, k);
        }
        
        if (dp[count][curIndex] != -1) {
            return dp[count][curIndex];

                           dfs(curIndex + 1, count + 1, events[curIndex][1], events, k) + events[curIndex][2]);
        dp[count][curIndex] = ans;
