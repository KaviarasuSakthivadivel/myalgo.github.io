Given the `root` of a binary tree, collect a tree's nodes as if you were doing this:

- Collect all the leaf nodes.
- Remove all the leaf nodes.
- Repeat until the tree is empty.

**Example 1:**

![[remleaves-tree_366.jpeg]]

**Input:** root = [1,2,3,4,5]
**Output:** [[4,5,3],[2],[1]]
Explanation:
[[3,5,4],[2],[1]] and [[3,4,5],[2],[1]] are also considered correct answers since per each level it does not matter the order on which elements are returned.

## Solution

To do this, we modify our `getHeight` method to directly insert the node's value in the solution array at the correct location. Solution array is kept empty in the beginning and as we encounter elements with increasing height, we'll keep increasing the size of the solution array to accomodate for these elements. For example, if our solution array currently is `[[4, 3, 5]]` and if we want to insert 2 at the second position, we first create the space for 2 by increasing the size of the solution array by 1 and then insert 2 at it's correct location.

- `[[4, 3, 5]] -> [[4, 3, 5], []] # increase the size of solution array`
    
- `[[4, 3, 5], []] -> [[4, 3, 5], [2]] # insert 2 at it's correct location`



```java
class Solution {
    private List<List<Integer>> solution;
    
    // DFS solution
    private int getHeightAndFindSolution(TreeNode root) {
        if(root == null) {
            return -1;
        }
        
        int leftHeight = getHeightAndFindSolution(root.left);
        int rightHeight = getHeightAndFindSolution(root.right);
        
        int currentHeight = 1 + Math.max(leftHeight, rightHeight);
        if(currentHeight == solution.size()) {
            solution.add(new ArrayList<>());
        }
        
        solution.get(currentHeight).add(root.val);
        
        return currentHeight;
    }
    
    public List<List<Integer>> findLeaves(TreeNode root) {
        this.solution = new ArrayList<>();
        
        getHeightAndFindSolution(root);
        
        return solution;
    }
}
```
