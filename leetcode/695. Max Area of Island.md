You are given an `m x n` binary matrix `grid`. An island is a group of `1`'s (representing land) connected **4-directionally** (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

The **area** of an island is the number of cells with a value `1` in the island.

Return _the maximum **area** of an island in_ `grid`. If there is no island, return `0`.

**Input:** grid = [[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** The answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.

### Solution

Do DFS, call 4 directions separately and add one to it!221. Maximal Square

```java
class Solution {
    int[][] grid;
    boolean[][] seen;

    public int area(int r, int c) {
        if (r < 0 || r >= grid.length || c < 0 || c >= grid[0].length ||
                seen[r][c] || grid[r][c] == 0)
            return 0;
        seen[r][c] = true;
        return (1 + area(r+1, c) + area(r-1, c)
                  + area(r, c-1) + area(r, c+1));
    }

    public int maxAreaOfIsland(int[][] grid) {
        this.grid = grid;
        seen = new boolean[grid.length][grid[0].length];
        int ans = 0;
        for (int r = 0; r < grid.length; r++) {
            for (int c = 0; c < grid[0].length; c++) {
                ans = Math.max(ans, area(r, c));
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
