We are given an array `asteroids` of integers representing asteroids in a row.

For each asteroid, the absolute value represents its size, and the sign represents its direction (positive meaning right, negative meaning left). Each asteroid moves at the same speed.

Find out the state of the asteroids after all collisions. If two asteroids meet, the smaller one will explode. If both are the same size, both will explode. Two asteroids moving in the same direction will never meet.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** asteroids = [5,10,-5]
**Output:** [5,10]
**Explanation:** The 10 and -5 collide resulting in 10. The 5 and 10 never collide.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** asteroids = [8,-8]
**Output:** []
**Explanation:** The 8 and -8 collide exploding each other.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** asteroids = [10,2,-5]
**Output:** [10]
**Explanation:** The 2 and -5 collide resulting in -5. The 10 and -5 collide resulting in 10.


### Solution

**Intuition**

We have NNN asteroids, each represented by an integer. The absolute value represents the size, and the sign (positive or negative) of the integer represents the direction the asteroid is moving; all stones are moving at the same speed. These asteroids can collide, and if they do, the smaller one explodes and vanishes. If both asteroids are of the same size, then both will explode. We need to return the final state of asteroids after all collisions.

The first important thing to find out is when two asteroids will collide. Two stones moving in the same direction can never collide. Hence it's tempting to assume that whenever two asteroids are moving in opposite directions, they will collide. However, consider the below image; the red stone is moving in the left direction, and the blue stone is moving in the right direction. It is clear from the picture these two asteroids will never collide.

On the other hand, if the red stone is moving towards the right and the blue stone is moving towards the left, they will collide, as shown below. Therefore, the only case when the asteroids will collide is when the asteroid on the left-hand side is moving towards the right, and the asteroid on the right side is moving towards the left.

Now, if we iterate over asteroids from left to right, then each asteroid moving left will collide with asteroids that came before it that are moving right. If the current stone is smaller than the one we saw earlier, it will explode, and the collision chain will stop there. On the other hand, if it's bigger, it will keep moving toward the left and might collide further with other asteroids we saw earlier that are moving toward the right. Hence, the observation here is that each stone might keep colliding with asteroids on its left until it collides with a bigger asteroid and explodes. This requirement could be fulfilled by the stack data structure; if we keep asteroids in the stack, then for each asteroid, the collision chain can be executed by checking the top of the stack and popping if an asteroid should be destroyed.

            while(!stack.isEmpty() && stack.peek() > 0 && a < 0) { // it will collide
                if(Math.abs(stack.peek()) < Math.abs(a)) {
                    stack.pop();
                    continue; // Check for other values in the stack and discard the smaller value on the stack;
