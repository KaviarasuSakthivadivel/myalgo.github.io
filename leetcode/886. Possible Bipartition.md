We want to split a group of `n` people (labeled from `1` to `n`) into two groups of **any size**. Each person may dislike some other people, and they should not go into the same group.

Given the integer `n` and the array `dislikes` where `dislikes[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that the person labeled `ai` does not like the person labeled `bi`, return `true` _if it is possible to split everyone into two groups in this way_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 4, dislikes = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,4]]
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** The first group has [1,4], and the second group has [2,3].

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 3, dislikes = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** We need at least 3 groups to divide them. We cannot put them in two groups.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 2000`
- `0 <= dislikes.length <= 104`
- `dislikes[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= ai < bi <= n`
- All the pairs of `dislikes` are **unique**.

## Solution

### Overview

The problem asks us to divide the given people into two groups such that no two people in the same group dislike each other.

We can represent this problem in the form of a graph, with people being the nodes and disliked pairs being the edges. Our task is to figure out whether we can divide the nodes into two sets such that there aren't any edges between nodes of the same set.

A graph satisfying the above condition is said to be a [bipartite graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartite_graph). The following is an example of such a graph:

In the above image, the nodes are split into groups of blue and red nodes, and within each group, there are no connecting edges.

### Approach 1: Breadth First Search

#### Intuition

Our task is to figure out whether we can divide the nodes (i.e., people) into two sets such that there aren't any edges between nodes in the same set. Intuitively, we can think of starting a traversal over such a graph. We can put the first node into the first set and all the neighbors of the node into the second set. Now, we can move one step further to the neighbours and put their neighbours in the first set. We can perform the same process to keep alternating sets between neighbors. We can use a breadth-first search traversal to assign the set to each of the nodes.

A breadth-first search (BFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching a graph. It traverses in a level-wise manner, i.e., all the nodes at the present level (say `l`) are explored before moving on to the nodes at the next level (`l + 1`), where a level's number is the distance from a starting node. BFS is implemented with a queue.

If you are not familiar with BFS traversal, we suggest you read our [Leetcode Explore Card](https://leetcode.com/explore/featured/card/graph/620/breadth-first-search-in-graph/).

Our task is to split the nodes into two sets such that there aren't any edges between the nodes of the same set. Let's start by giving a unique identification/color to both groups. To distinguish them, we can use two colors, say, `RED` and `BLUE`. We need to assign a color to each node in such a way that all its neighbors (nodes that share an edge) do not have that color. Otherwise, it would result in a conflict.

To solve this problem, we can start a BFS traversal over the graph of people and start assigning the colors. We can assign `RED` to the starting node (it doesn't matter which color we choose for the first node). The color `BLUE` should then be assigned to all of the neighbors. Neighbors of `BLUE` nodes should have the color `RED`, and so on (keep alternating colors between neighbors). In the implementation, we can use a number to identify each color. Let's use `0` for `RED` and `1` for `BLUE`.

To flip the colors, we can use the formula `1 - color`. If we are at a `RED` node, then `1 - color = 1 - 0 = 1 = BLUE`. If we are at a `BLUE` node, then `1 - color = 1 - 1 = 0 = RED`.

There can be multiple connected components in the graph. We need to visit all of them to make sure we visit every node. In a single BFS traversal, we will visit all the nodes present in one connected component and color each of them accordingly. Here's an example of a successful split and an unsuccessful split of a graph having three components each:

#### Algorithm

1. Create an adjacency list where `adj[X]` contains all the neighbors of node `X`.
2. Initialize an array `color`, storing the color assigned to each node. Initialize it to `-1` for all nodes to indicate no colors have been assigned yet.
3. Run a loop over all the nodes and check if there is any node `i` which is uncolored.
4. If a node `i` has not been colored (`color[i] = -1`), start a BFS traversal which will cover all the nodes present in the same component as node `i`.
    - Initialize a queue with `i` in the queue.
    - Assign a color to the source node `i`, let's say `RED = 0`.
5. Then, while the queue is not empty:
    - Dequeue the first `node` from the queue.
    - Iterate over all the neighbors of `node` and check if any `neighbor` has the same color as `node`. If any neighbor matches, then we have a conflict, so return false.
    - If a color is not yet assigned to the `neighbor`, assign the opposite color to it. Then, put the neighbor onto the queue.
6. If any BFS traversal has a conflict, we return `false` as the answer. Otherwise, we return `true` if we get through every node without conflict.

Here's a visual example of the BFS traversal:

```java
class Solution {
    private boolean bfs(int source, Map<Integer, List<Integer>> graph, int[] color) {
        Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        queue.add(source);

        color[source] = 0;

        while(!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int u = queue.poll();

            for(int v : graph.getOrDefault(u, new LinkedList<>())) {
                if(color[v] == color[u]) {
                    return false;
                } else {
                    if(color[v] == -1) {
                        color[v] = 1 - color[u];
                        queue.add(v);
                    }
                    
                }
            }
        }
        return true;
    }

    public boolean possibleBipartition(int n, int[][] dislikes) {
        Map<Integer, List<Integer>> graph = new HashMap<>();
        for(int[] dislike : dislikes) {
            int u = dislike[0], v = dislike[1];

            graph.computeIfAbsent(u, l -> new LinkedList<>()).add(v);
            graph.computeIfAbsent(v, l -> new LinkedList<>()).add(u);
        }

        int[] color = new int[n + 1];
        Arrays.fill(color, -1); // 0 for red, 1 for blue

        for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            if(color[i] == -1) {
                if(!bfs(i, graph, color)) { // if there is a conflict.
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }

        return true;
    }
}
