A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to **any of the peaks**.

You may imagine that `nums[-1] = nums[n] = -∞`. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(log n)` time.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3,1]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.

## Solution

We start off by finding the middle element, midmidmid from the given nums array. If this element happens to be lying in a descending sequence of numbers. or a local falling slope(found by comparing nums[i] to its right neighbour), it means that the peak will always lie towards the left of this element. Thus, we reduce the search space to the left of mid(including itself) and perform the same process on left subarray.

If the middle element, midmidmid lies in an ascending sequence of numbers, or a rising slope(found by comparing nums[i] to its right neighbour), it obviously implies that the peak lies towards the right of this element. Thus, we reduce the search space to the right of midmidmid and perform the same process on the right subarray.

```java
class Solution {
    public int findPeakElement(int[] nums) {
        int low = 0, high = nums.length - 1;
        
        while(low < high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            
            if(nums[mid] > nums[mid + 1]) {
                high = mid;
            } else {
                low = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        
        // We can break when low == high. Due to the two points mentioned above, both low and high will be pointing at the maximum number of the bitonic array.
        
        return low;
    }
}
