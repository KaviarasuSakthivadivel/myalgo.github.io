You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day** to buy one stock and choosing a **different day in the future** to sell that stock.

Return _the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction_. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= prices.length <= 105`
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 104`

## Solution


### Approach 2: One Pass

#### Algorithm

Say the given array is:

```csharp
[7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
```

If we plot the numbers of the given array on a graph, we get:

![[121_profit_graph.png]]

The points of interest are the peaks and valleys in the given graph. We need to find the largest price following each valley, which difference could be the max profit.  
We can maintain two variables - minprice and maxprofit corresponding to the smallest valley and maximum profit (maximum difference between selling price and minprice) obtained so far respectively.


```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int cost = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int profit = 0;
        for(int i = 0 ; i < prices.length ; i++) {
            cost = Math.min(cost, prices[i]);
            profit = Math.max(profit, prices[i] - cost);
        }
        
        return profit;
    }
}
```
