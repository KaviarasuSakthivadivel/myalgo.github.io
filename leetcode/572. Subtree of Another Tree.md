Given the roots of two binary trees `root` and `subRoot`, return `true` if there is a subtree of `root` with the same structure and node values of `subRoot` and `false` otherwise.

A subtree of a binary tree `tree` is a tree that consists of a node in `tree` and all of this node's descendants. The tree `tree` could also be considered as a subtree of itself.

**Input:** root = [3,4,5,1,2], subRoot = [4,1,2]
**Output:** true

## Solution

### Overview

In this problem, we are given roots of two binary trees, `root` and `subRoot`. We need to check if there is a subtree in the "tree rooted at `root`" such that the structure and node value of that subtree is the same as the "tree rooted at `subRoot`".

Throughout the article we will use the following notation:

- NNN is the number of nodes in the tree rooted at the `root`
    
- MMM is the number of nodes in the tree rooted at `subRoot`
    

Note that for the tree rooted at `subRoot` to be a subtree of the tree rooted at `root`, N≥MN \geq MN≥M. However, we don't know MMM and NNN beforehand. So, we can't immediately return `false` if N<MN < MN<M.

Thus, whatever may be the approach, we ultimately have to compare both trees. In the article, we will see how to make this comparison optimal.

### Approach 1: Depth First Search

#### Intuition

Let's consider the most naive approach first. We can traverse the tree rooted at `root` (using Depth First Search) and for each `node` in the tree, check if the "tree rooted at that `node`" is identical to the "tree rooted at `subRoot`". If we find such a `node`, we can return `true`. If traversing the entire tree rooted at `root` doesn't yield any such `node`, we can return `false`.

Since we have to check for identicality, again and again, we can write a function `isIdentical` which takes two roots of two trees and returns `true` if the trees are identical and `false` otherwise.

Checking the identicality of two trees is a classical task. We can use the same approach as the one in [Same Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/same-tree/) Problem. We can traverse both trees simultaneously and

- if any of the two nodes being checked is `null`, then for trees to be identical, both the nodes should be `null`. Otherwise, the trees are not identical.
    
- if both nodes are non-empty. Then for the tree to be identical, ensure that
    
    - values of the nodes are the same
    - left subtrees are identical
    - right subtrees are identical

#### Algorithm

1. Create a function `dfs` that takes `node` as the argument. This function will return `true` if the "tree rooted at `node`" is identical to the "tree rooted at `subRoot`" and `false` otherwise.
    
    Now, if for any `node`, "tree rooted at `node`" is identical to the "tree rooted at `subRoot`", then we can be sure that there is a subtree in the "tree rooted at `root`" which is identical to the "tree rooted at `subRoot`".
    
2. For `dfs`,
    
    - if `node` is `null`, we can return `false` because the `null` node cannot be identical to a tree rooted at `subRoot`, which as per constraints is not `null`.
        
    - else if, check for the identicality of the "tree rooted at `node`" and the "tree rooted at `subRoot`" using the function `isIdentical`, if trees are identical, return `true`.
        
    - otherwise, call the `dfs` function for the left child of `node`, and the right child of `node`. If either of them returns `true`, return `true`. Otherwise, return `false`.
        
3. Create the function `isIdentical` which takes two roots of two trees (namely `node1` and `node2`) and returns `true` if the trees are identical and `false` otherwise.
    
4. For `isIdentical`,
    
    - if any one of the two nodes is `null`, then both should be `null` for the trees to be identical. Otherwise, the trees are not identical, and we can return `false`.
        
    - if both nodes are not `null`, then for trees to be identical, all three conditions should be met.
        
        - the values of the nodes should be the same. This can be checked by `node1->val == node2->val`
            
        - left subtrees should be identical. This can be checked by `isIdentical(node1->left, node2->left)`
            
        - right subtrees should be identical. This can be checked by `isIdentical(node1->right, node2->right)`
            
5. Now, call the function `dfs` for the root of the tree rooted at `root`. If it returns `true`, return `true`. Otherwise, return `false`.

class Solution {
    //For each node during pre-order traversal of s, use a recursive function isSame to validate if sub-tree started with this node is the same with t.

            return false;
        }
        if(isSame(s, t)) {
            return true;
        }
        return isSubtree(s.left, t) || isSubtree(s.right, t);
    }

            return true;
        }
        if(s == null || t == null) {
            return false;
        }
        
        if(t.val != s.val) {
            return false;
        }
        return isSame(s.left, t.left) && isSame(s.right, t.right);
    }
    
    
    public boolean isSubtreeUsingPreOrder(TreeNode s, TreeNode t) {
        String s1 = getPreOrderString(s, true);
        String s2 = getPreOrderString(t, false);
        return s1.indexOf(s2) >= 0;
    }
    
    String getPreOrderString(TreeNode root, Boolean left) {
        if(root == null) {
            if(left) {
                return "lnull";
            } else {
                return "rnull";
            }
        }
        
        return "#" + root.val + " " + getPreOrderString(root.left, true) + " " + getPreOrderString(root.right, false);
    }
}
```


### Approach 2: String Matching

#### Intuition

In this problem, what we are doing can be broadly labeled as pattern matching. We are trying to match the "tree rooted at `root`" portion with the "tree rooted at `subRoot`". As you may recall, [String Matching](https://leetcode.com/tag/string-matching/) is a famous field in pattern matching, and we have many classical algorithms in this field. Particularly, we have a very similar problem but with strings: [finding if a string is a substring of another string](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-index-of-the-first-occurrence-in-a-string/).

> **Can we somehow port the String Matching to this problem?**  
> Yes, we can if there is a mechanism to convert the trees into strings and then use string-matching algorithms to solve this problem. After that, the problem boils down to [finding if a string is a substring of another string](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-index-of-the-first-occurrence-in-a-string/).

The task now is to find a mechanism to transform the trees into strings. This comes under the standard [Tree Serialization Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/serialize-and-deserialize-binary-tree/) problem.

What we can do is convert the trees into strings. Let `r` be the string corresponding to the tree rooted at `root` and `s` be the string corresponding to the tree rooted at `subRoot`. Then, we can check if `s` is a substring of `r`. If it is, then `subRoot` is a subtree of `root`. If not, then `subRoot` is not a subtree of `root`.

However, there are multiple pitfalls in this approach.

**How to serialize a tree into a string?**  
_Note that serialization contains information about the node values as well as information about the tree structure._

##### Tree Traversals [Incorrect]

The most intuitive way is to traverse the tree and add each node's value to the string. Now, there are multiple ways to [traverse the tree](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/data-structure-tree/134/traverse-a-tree/). We can either do a pre-order traversal, in-order traversal, post-order traversal, or can even do a level-order traversal. However, it turns out that none of them is sufficient to uniquely identify a tree. This can be understood by the following examples:

Let our tree rooted at `root` be `t`

![[572_root_tree_t.svg]]

[Level Order Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-level-order-traversal/) of `t` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, serialized as `12345`.  
Consider these two trees `p` and `q`

![[572_level_pre.svg]]

Both have level order traversals as `345`, hence level order traversal of both trees is a substring of `12345`. However, `p` is a subtree of `t`, but `q` is not a subtree of `t`. It is a case of False Positive.

Moreover, consider tree `x`.

![[572_root_tree_x.svg]]

1. From the diagram, we can see that `p` is a subtree of `x`. Now, the level-order traversal of `x` is `123645`. But, the string of `p`, `345`, is not a substring of `123645`. It is a case of False Negative.
    
2. [Pre Order Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-preorder-traversal/) of `t` is `12345`.  
    Consider these two trees `p` and `q`
![[572_level_pre (1).svg]]

1. Both have pre-order traversals as `345`, hence pre-order traversal of both trees is a substring of `12345`. However, `p` is a subtree of `t`, but `q` is not a subtree of `t`.
    
2. [Post Order Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-postorder-traversal/) of `t` is `24531`.  
    Consider these two trees `p` and `q`
![[572_post.svg]]

1. Both have post-order traversals as `453`, hence post-order traversal of both trees is a substring of `24531`. However, `p` is a subtree of `t`, but `q` is not a subtree of `t`.
    
2. [In Order Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-inorder-traversal/) of `t` is `21435`.  
    Consider these two trees `p` and `q`
![[572_in.svg]]

1. Both have in order traversals as `435`, hence in order traversal of both trees is a substring of `21435`. However, `p` is a subtree of `t`, but `q` is not a subtree of `t`.
    

Thus, a single traversal is not sufficient, since inorder, preorder, or postorder traversal of different binary trees can be the same.

##### Two Traversals [Incorrect]

> For Constructing a Unique Binary Tree from traversal, we necessarily need to know its Inorder Traversal along with either [Preorder](https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-binary-tree-from-preorder-and-inorder-traversal/) or [Postorder](https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-binary-tree-from-inorder-and-postorder-traversal/) Traversal.
> 
> Note that we can't construct a unique binary tree from only Preorder or Postorder Traversal, inorder traversal is necessary.
> 
> Suppose we are given preorder as `XY` and postorder as `YX`. It is clear that `X` is the root, but we can't find out whether `Y` is the left child or right child of `X`.

Using the above fact, one might induce to include both Inorder and Preorder (or Inorder and Postorder) Traversal in the string. However, this is not sufficient either. Consider these examples

1. Tree might contain duplicate nodes. Hence, the "inorder and preorder (or inorder and postorder)" traversal of two different trees can be the same.
    
    **q**
    
    ```
      3
     / \
    2   4
    
    Inorder  : 234
    Preorder : 324
      
    ```
    
    **t**
    
    ```
          1
         / \
        4   4
       / \ 
      2   2
     / \ 
    1   3
    
    Inorder  : 1234214
    Preorder : 1421324
      
    ```
    
    Now, `234` is contained in `1234214`, **and** `324` is contained in `1421324`. However, as visible `q` is not a subtree of `t`.
    
2. Even if node values are unique, we can't use "inorder and preorder (or inorder and postorder)" traversal. Consider this example.
    
    **q**
    
    ```
      4
     / \
    3   5
    
    Inorder  : 345
    Preorder : 435
     
    ```
    
    **t**
    
    ```
      2  
     / \ 
    1   4
       / \
      3   5
           \
            6
    
    Inorder  : 123456
    Preorder : 214356
    ```
    
    Now, `345` is contained in `123456`, **and** `435` is contained in `214356`. However, `q` is not a subtree of `t`.
    
    Another simple example of the same  
    **a**
    
    ```
      1
     / \
    2   3
    
    Inorder  : 213
    Preorder : 123
     
    ```
    
    **b**
    
    ```
      1  
     / \ 
    2   3
         \
          4
    
    Inorder  : 2134
    Preorder : 1234
     
    ```
    
    Again, `213` is contained in `2134`, **and** `123` is contained in `1234`. However, `a` is not a subtree of `b`.
    
    One might get confused that why `a` is not a subtree of `b`. The reason is that, in `b`, `3` has a right child `4`, but in `a`, `3` doesn't have any right child. Hence, `a` is not a subtree of `b`.  
    More technically, left and right children of `3` of `a` are not the same as the left and right children of `3` of `b`. A similar case holds for `5` of `q` and `5` of `t` of Example-2.
    

##### Correct Serialization Method

It turns out that if we include `#` or any other character for the `null` node while serializing, then **we can uniquely identify a tree**, that too with only one traversal (either preorder or postorder).

> **Preorder Traversal (or postorder traversal) with markers for `null` node unique determines Binary Tree**
> 
> In preorder traversal, we are sure that the first node is the root node. Now, the next node in the serialized is the root of the left subtree. If the next node is
> 
> - `#` node, it means that the root node doesn't have any left child. The node after `#` will be the root of the right subtree.
>

>     
>     - `#` node, it means that the left child doesn't have any left child. The node after `#` will be the root of the right subtree of the left child.
>     - non-`#` node, which means that the left child has a left child. The node after the left child will be the root of the left subtree of the left child of the left child. And so on.
> 
> Thus, with preorder traversal, we can determine the root, and its left and right subtree.
> 
> _As an exercise, readers can verify for all examples discussed so far that if we include `#` for NULL Node, then [pre-order](https://leetcode.com/problems/subtree-of-another-tree/) (or post-order) traversal is unique._

> Please note that **only** in-order traversal (with markers for NULL Node) is still **not** sufficient to uniquely identify, as it is difficult to locate the root node in the serialized string as the root is visited in between the left and right subtree. Consider these two trees.

> ```
>          1                   2

>        2    2              1    4
>            /  \           / \  
>           3    4         2   3 
> ```
> 
> Both have in-order traversal as `#2#1#3#2#4#`.

Now, if we have NNN nodes in a tree, then there will be N+1N+1N+1 `null` nodes in the tree. Hence, the serialized string will have 2N+12N+12N+1 characters.

However, there is again one minute limitation. Consider these two single-node trees.

```
    2               22
```

They have serialized pre-order strings as `2##` and `22##` respectively. Now, since `2##` is a substring of `22##`, our approach will conclude that the first tree is a subtree of the second tree. However, this is not the case.

We can overcome this by adding a character (let it be `^`, or simply space ) before adding the node's value. Now, `^2##` is not a substring of `^22##`.  
_(Has it been postorder traversal, we need to add `^` after adding the node's value.)_

##### String Matching Algorithms

After serializing both the trees, with the above-mentioned approach, we need to check if the string corresponding to `subRoot`, named as `s` is in string corresponding to `root`, named as `r`. This comes under the classic [string matching](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-index-of-the-first-occurrence-in-a-string/) problem.

> The naive approach for string matching is O(R×S)O(R \times S)O(R×S), where RRR is the length of string `r` and SSS is the length of string `s`. However, there are better algorithms like the **Knuth-Morris-Pratt** algorithm, which can do it in O(R+S)O(R + S)O(R+S) time. For understanding KMP, one may check this [editorial](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-index-of-the-first-occurrence-in-a-string/editorial)

Hence, concluding we will serialize two trees into strings, and then check if the string corresponding to `subRoot` is a substring of the string corresponding to `root` using the Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm.

#### Algorithm

1. Define a function `serialize` which takes a `node`, and a string/list `tree_str` and serializes the node by appending it to that list. This function will serialize the tree in preorder traversal and will add `^` before adding the node's value. For `null` nodes, it will add `#`.
    
2. Serialize `root` and `subRoot` into strings `r` and `s` respectively.
    
3. Check if `s` is a substring of `r`. There are multiple ways of doing so.
    
    - one can use inbuilt `indexOf` function in Java, or `find` function in Python, or `index` function in C++.
        
    - one can use [Naive approach](https://leetcode.com/problems/subtree-of-another-tree/editorial/).
        
    - one can use the linear Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm, which is discussed in [this editorial](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-index-of-the-first-occurrence-in-a-string/editorial).
        
4. Return `true` if `s` is a substring of `r`, else return `false`.
