# 190. Reverse Bits

Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.

**Note:**

- Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, both input and output will be given as a signed integer type. They should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.
- In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using [2's complement notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement). Therefore, in **Example 2** above, the input represents the signed integer `-3` and the output represents the signed integer `-1073741825`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 00000010100101000001111010011100
**Output:**    964176192 (00111001011110000010100101000000)
**Explanation:** The input binary string **00000010100101000001111010011100** represents the unsigned integer 43261596, so return 964176192 which its binary representation is **00111001011110000010100101000000**.

```java
public class Solution {
    // you need treat n as an unsigned value
    public int reverseBits(int n) {
        if(n == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int result = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
            result <<= 1;
            
            if((n & 1) == 1) {
                result++;
            }
            
            n >>= 1;
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```
