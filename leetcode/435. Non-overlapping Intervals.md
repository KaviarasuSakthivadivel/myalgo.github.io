Given an array of intervals `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`, return _the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** [1,3] can be removed and the rest of the intervals are non-overlapping.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** intervals = [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** intervals = [[1,2],[2,3]]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.

### **Solution**

**Actually, the problem is the same as "Given a collection of intervals, find the maximum number of intervals that are non-overlapping." (the classic Greedy problem: Interval Scheduling). With the solution to that problem, guess how do we get the minimum number of intervals to remove? : )

Sorting Interval.end in ascending order is O(nlogn), then traverse intervals array to get the maximum number of non-overlapping intervals is O(n). Total is O(nlogn).**

```java
class Solution {
    public int eraseOverlapIntervals(int[][] intervals) {
        
        if(intervals.length < 2) {
            return 0;
        }   
        
        Arrays.sort(intervals, Comparator.comparingInt(a -> a[1]));
        int maxEnd = intervals[0][1];
        int overlappingIntervalsCount = 1;
    
        for(int i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++) {
            System.out.println(intervals[i][0] + " : " + intervals[i][1]);
            int[] current = intervals[i];
            if(current[0] >= maxEnd) {
                maxEnd = current[1];
                overlappingIntervalsCount++;
            }
        }
        
        return intervals.length - overlappingIntervalsCount;
    }
}
```
