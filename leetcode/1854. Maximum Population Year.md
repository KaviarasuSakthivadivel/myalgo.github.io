You are given a 2D integer array `logs` where each `logs[i] = [birthi, deathi]` indicates the birth and death years of the `ith` person.

The **population** of some year `x` is the number of people alive during that year. The `ith` person is counted in year `x`'s population if `x` is in the **inclusive** range `[birthi, deathi - 1]`. Note that the person is **not** counted in the year that they die.

Return _the **earliest** year with the **maximum population**_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** logs = [[1993,1999],[2000,2010]]
**Output:** 1993
**Explanation:** The maximum population is 1, and 1993 is the earliest year with this population.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** logs = [[1950,1961],[1960,1971],[1970,1981]]
**Output:** 1960
**Explanation:** 
The maximum population is 2, and it had happened in years 1960 and 1970.
The earlier year between them is 1960.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= logs.length <= 100`
- `1950 <= birthi < deathi <= 2050`


## Solution

Suppose we are given the log [1950, 1961]  
This means birth year is 1950 and death year is 1961  
Therefore, years from 1950 to 1960 will be incremented by 1.

We can do it by iterating from 1950 to 1960 but that will increase time complexity if we have to do it for every query in logs array.

To do this in O(1), we increment year[1950] by 1 and decrement year[1961] by 1.  
We can reapeat this for every query in logs array.

What will this do ?

For the case [1950, 1961], let's look at how the array will look like

But this is not the desired result ?

To get the answer,  
After iterating through all the queries, take prefix sum of the array(year)  
This is how the array will look like

You can see that the Prefix Sum row will give the desired result as we have incremented the values of array from index 1950 to 1960.

Let's try for the test case, logs = [[1950,1961],[1960,1965],[1963,1970]] for a better understanding

Looking at the Prefix Sum, we can clearly see that the maximum value is 2 and its first occurence is at 1960. Hence, 1960 is the answer.

```java
class Solution {
    public int maximumPopulation(int[][] logs) {
        int[] noOfPeopleArr = new int[101]; // Since the maximum of logs is 100.

        for(int[] log : logs) {
            noOfPeopleArr[log[0] - 1950]++;
            noOfPeopleArr[log[1] - 1950]--;
        }

        int maxYear = 1950, maxPopulation = noOfPeopleArr[0];
        for(int i = 1; i < noOfPeopleArr.length; i++) {
            noOfPeopleArr[i] += noOfPeopleArr[i - 1];

            if(noOfPeopleArr[i] > maxPopulation) {
                maxPopulation = noOfPeopleArr[i];
                maxYear = i + 1950;
            }
        }

        return maxYear;
    }
}
```
