A company has `n` employees with a unique ID for each employee from `0` to `n - 1`. The head of the company is the one with `headID`.

Each employee has one direct manager given in the `manager` array where `manager[i]` is the direct manager of the `i-th` employee, `manager[headID] = -1`. Also, it is guaranteed that the subordination relationships have a tree structure.

The head of the company wants to inform all the company employees of an urgent piece of news. He will inform his direct subordinates, and they will inform their subordinates, and so on until all employees know about the urgent news.

The `i-th` employee needs `informTime[i]` minutes to inform all of his direct subordinates (i.e., After informTime[i] minutes, all his direct subordinates can start spreading the news).

Return _the number of minutes_ needed to inform all the employees about the urgent news.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 1, headID = 0, manager = [-1], informTime = [0]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** The head of the company is the only employee in the company.

## Solution

#### Overview

There are NNN employees in a company with IDs from 000 to N−1N - 1N−1; the company forms a tree structure with the root as `headID`. Each employee except the `headID` has a manager, which is present in the array `manager`. Also, each employee needs some time to inform their subordinates of any piece of information, which is provided by the array `informTime`. An employee passes on the information to all the subordinates at the same time. We need to find out how long it takes for all the employees to receive the information from the head employee.

If we know when each employee will know the information, we can just find the maximum of all and return that. Hence, we need to find a way to iterate over all the employees with keeping the time they were made aware of the information. In this article, we will discuss two ways of iterating with the constraints we need.

The image below is showing a tree structure with thirteen employees, each having an informing time as shown in the array. The numbers above each node are when they receive the information, hence the `headID` has the information at `0`, and its subordinates get it at `informTime[headID]` and so on.

#### Approach 1: Depth-First Search (DFS)

**Intuition**

Before we use any iterating algorithm, we need to prepare the tree in a way we can iterate quickly. The information starts from the `headID` at time `0`, then it traverses to its subordinates at the time `informTime[headID]`, and then their subordinates pass it on to their subordinates, and so on. Therefore, we need the parent-to-child relationship to iterate instead of the child-to-parent relationship that we have in the input. To do this, we would create an edge from `manager[i]` to `i` when the `manager[i]` isn't `-1`.

We start the DFS from the root node, i.e. `headID` with the `time` as `0`, then we iterate over its subordinates with `time` as `time + informTime[parent]`. Before we iterate over the subordinates, we update the variable `maxTime`, which is the maximum `time` we have seen so far. In the end, we can just return the `maxTime`, which is the time for the employee that got the information at last.

```java
class Solution {
    int maxTime = Integer.MIN_VALUE;

    void DFS(ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>> adjList, int[] informTime, int curr, int time) {
        // Maximum time for an employee to get the news.
        maxTime = Math.max(maxTime, time);

        for (int adjacent : adjList.get(curr)) {
            // Visit the subordinate employee who gets the news after informTime[curr] unit time.
            DFS(adjList, informTime, adjacent, time + informTime[curr]);
        }
    }

    public int numOfMinutes(int n, int headID, int[] manager, int[] informTime) {
        ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>> adjList = new ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>>(n);

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            adjList.add(new ArrayList<Integer>());
        }

        // Making an adjacent list, each index stores the Ids of subordinate employees.
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (manager[i] != -1) {
                adjList.get(manager[i]).add(i);
            }
        }

        DFS(adjList, informTime, headID, 0);
        return maxTime;
    }
}
```
