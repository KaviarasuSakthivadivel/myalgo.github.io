You are given an integer array `nums`. In one move, you can pick an index `i` where `0 <= i < nums.length` and increment `nums[i]` by `1`.

Return _the minimum number of moves to make every value in_ `nums` _**unique**_.

The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a 32-bit integer.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,2]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** After 1 move, the array could be [1, 2, 3].

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [3,2,1,2,1,7]
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** After 6 moves, the array could be [3, 4, 1, 2, 5, 7].
It can be shown with 5 or less moves that it is impossible for the array to have all unique values.

## Solution

The idea is to sort the input -O(nlogn)- , then we move forward from the beginning of the array till the end.
As soon as we found a condition that the current element is less than or equal to the previous elements then we need to update the current array element.
here is an example of the given input.
A = [3,2,1,2,1,7]
Sorted A = [1,1,2,2,3,7]
After reaching the second 1 on the array since the condition is satisfied A[i]<=A[i-1] so we need to update the A[i] by A[i-1]+1.
At the same time we need to keep track of result by
result += A[i-1]+ 1 - A[i];

The rest of iterations are as following :

A = [1,2,2,2,3,7]
res= 1

A = [1,2,3,2,3,7]
res= 2

A = [1,2,3,4,3,7]
res= 4

A = [1,2,3,4,5,7]
res= 6

```java
class Solution {
    public int minIncrementForUnique(int[] nums) {
        int count = 0;
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int prevNum = nums[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] <= prevNum) {
                prevNum++;
                count += (prevNum - nums[i]);
            } else {
                prevNum = nums[i];
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
