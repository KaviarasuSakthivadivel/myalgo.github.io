Determine if a `9 x 9` Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated **according to the following rules**:

1. Each row must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.
2. Each column must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.
3. Each of the nine `3 x 3` sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.

**Note:**

- A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
- Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.

## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isValidSudoku(char[][] board) {
        int N = 9;
        
        HashSet<Character>[] rows = new HashSet[N];
        HashSet<Character>[] columns = new HashSet[N];
        HashSet<Character>[] boxes = new HashSet[N];
        
        for(int i = 0 ; i < N; i++) {
            rows[i] = new HashSet<Character>();
            columns[i] = new HashSet<Character>();
            boxes[i] = new HashSet<Character>();
        }
        
        for(int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            for(int j = 0; j < N; j++) {
                char val = board[i][j];
                if(val == '.') {
                    continue;
                }
                
                
                if(rows[i].contains(val)) {
                    return false;
                }
                
                rows[i].add(val);
                
                if(columns[j].contains(val)) {
                    return false;
                }
                
                columns[j].add(val);
                
                int idx = (i / 3) * 3 + (j / 3);
                
                if(boxes[idx].contains(val)) {
                    return false;
                }
                
                boxes[idx].add(val);
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }
}
```

A valid sudoku board should satisfy three conditions: (1) each row, (2) each column, and (3) each box has no duplicate numbers.

For instance, in example 1 from the problem description, for `board[2][1] = 9`, we need to check the following conditions.

![[Example_1_36.jpeg]]

1. Does number 9 appear more than once in the third row?
    
2. Does number 9 appear more than once in the second column?
    
3. Does number 9 appear more than once in the first box?
    

In order to check 9 rows, 9 columns, and 9 boxes, we need to distinguish each of these entities.  
It is comparatively intuitive to check for duplicates in each row and column, given the row index `r` and column index `c`.

We can create a hash set for each row. For `board[r][c]`, we check if the number already exists in the hash set corresponding to rthr^{th}rth row. If yes, this row contains a duplicate value, therefore the sudoku is not valid. Otherwise, we will proceed to check the next position until we finish scanning the whole sudoku board. The same logic can be applied to each column.

The tricky part is when we check the validity of each box. The question is, given row index `r` and column index `c`, how to assign the position to one of the 9 boxes correctly?  
The first observation is that, in each column, rows 0, 1, and 2 belong to the same box, as do rows 3, 4, and 5, and rows 6, 7, and 8.

What do they have in common? Every group of three belonging to the same box has the same outcome when we perform integer division by three. Therefore, we can use `r/3` (`/` signifies floor division) to ensure that the rows are grouped as expected and use `c/3` to ensure that the columns are grouped correctly. Then, `(r/3, c/3)` can uniquely mark each box, and we can directly use the tuple as the hash key if we want to create a hash set for each box.

Alternatively, we can use the numbers 0 through 8 to represent these boxes, where `(r/3) * 3 + (c/3)` is used calculate a number in the range from 0 to 8. I.e. the square located at `(r, c)` belongs to the box `(r/3) * 3 + (c/3)`.

Notice that reading from left to right, the box indices are continuous from 0 to 8, and will increase by column first.

For each row, column, and box, there are several ways to store which numbers have already appeared so far. Here are three that we will use in this article:

1. Create a hash set for each row, column, and box (see Approach 1 for illustration).
2. Create an array of length 9 with values 0 and 1 representing "not seen" and "previously seen" states, respectively (see Approach 2 for illustration).
3. Use a binary number with a value 0 or 1 at each position representing the previous occurrence of each number (see Approach 3 for illustration).

Many problems can be solved using hash sets, arrays, or binary numbers to record previously seen numbers, and below, we will show how each of these methods can be used to help check the validity of a sudoku board.
