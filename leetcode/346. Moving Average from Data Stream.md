Given a stream of integers and a window size, calculate the moving average of all integers in the sliding window.

Implement the `MovingAverage` class:

- `MovingAverage(int size)` Initializes the object with the size of the window `size`.
- `double next(int val)` Returns the moving average of the last `size` values of the stream.

**Example 1:**

**Input**
["MovingAverage", "next", "next", "next", "next"]
[[3], [1], [10], [3], [5]]
**Output**
[null, 1.0, 5.5, 4.66667, 6.0]

**Explanation**
MovingAverage movingAverage = new MovingAverage(3);
movingAverage.next(1); // return 1.0 = 1 / 1
movingAverage.next(10); // return 5.5 = (1 + 10) / 2
movingAverage.next(3); // return 4.66667 = (1 + 10 + 3) / 3
movingAverage.next(5); // return 6.0 = (10 + 3 + 5) / 3

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= size <= 1000`
- `-105 <= val <= 105`
- At most `104` calls will be made to `next`.

## Solution

```java

class MovingAverage {

    private int windowSum = 0, size;
    private Deque<Integer> queue;
    public MovingAverage(int size) {
        this.size = size;
        queue = new ArrayDeque<>();
    }
    
    public double next(int val) {
        queue.add(val);
        int head = (!queue.isEmpty() && queue.size() > size) ? queue.poll() : 0;
        windowSum = windowSum - head + val;
        
        return (windowSum * 1.0 / queue.size());
    }
}

```


#### Approach 3: Circular Queue with Array

**Intuition**

Other than the _deque_ data structure, one could also apply another fun data structure called `circular queue`, which is basically a queue with the circular shape.

- The major advantage of circular queue is that by adding a new element to a full circular queue, it automatically discards the oldest element. Unlike deque, we do not need to explicitly remove the oldest element.  
    
- Another advantage of circular queue is that a single index suffices to keep track of both ends of the queue, unlike deque where we have to keep a pointer for each end.

**Algorithm**

No need to resort to any library, one could easily implement a circular queue with a fixed-size array. The key to the implementation is the correlation between the index of `head` and `tail` elements, which we could summarize in the following formula:

tail=(head+1)mod  size\text{tail} = (\text{head} + 1) 

In other words, the `tail` element is right next to the `head` element. Once we move the head forward, we would overwrite the previous tail element.

```java
class MovingAverage {
  int size, head = 0, windowSum = 0, count = 0;
  int[] queue;
  public MovingAverage(int size) {
    this.size = size;
    queue = new int[size];
  }

  public double next(int val) {
    ++count;
    // calculate the new sum by shifting the window
    int tail = (head + 1) % size;
    windowSum = windowSum - queue[tail] + val;
    // move on to the next head
    head = (head + 1) % size;
    queue[head] = val;
    return windowSum * 1.0 / Math.min(size, count);
  }
}
```
