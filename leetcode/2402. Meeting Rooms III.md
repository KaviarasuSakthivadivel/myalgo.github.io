You are given an integer `n`. There are `n` rooms numbered from `0` to `n - 1`.

You are given a 2D integer array `meetings` where `meetings[i] = [starti, endi]` means that a meeting will be held during the **half-closed** time interval `[starti, endi)`. All the values of `starti` are **unique**.

Meetings are allocated to rooms in the following manner:

1. Each meeting will take place in the unused room with the **lowest** number.
2. If there are no available rooms, the meeting will be delayed until a room becomes free. The delayed meeting should have the **same** duration as the original meeting.
3. When a room becomes unused, meetings that have an earlier original **start** time should be given the room.

Return _the **number** of the room that held the most meetings._ If there are multiple rooms, return _the room with the **lowest** number._

A **half-closed interval** `[a, b)` is the interval between `a` and `b` **including** `a` and **not including** `b`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 2, meetings = [[0,10],[1,5],[2,7],[3,4]]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:**
- At time 0, both rooms are not being used. The first meeting starts in room 0.
- At time 1, only room 1 is not being used. The second meeting starts in room 1.
- At time 2, both rooms are being used. The third meeting is delayed.
- At time 3, both rooms are being used. The fourth meeting is delayed.
- At time 5, the meeting in room 1 finishes. The third meeting starts in room 1 for the time period [5,10).
- At time 10, the meetings in both rooms finish. The fourth meeting starts in room 0 for the time period [10,11).
Both rooms 0 and 1 held 2 meetings, so we return 0. 

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 3, meetings = [[1,20],[2,10],[3,5],[4,9],[6,8]]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:**
- At time 1, all three rooms are not being used. The first meeting starts in room 0.
- At time 2, rooms 1 and 2 are not being used. The second meeting starts in room 1.
- At time 3, only room 2 is not being used. The third meeting starts in room 2.
- At time 4, all three rooms are being used. The fourth meeting is delayed.
- At time 5, the meeting in room 2 finishes. The fourth meeting starts in room 2 for the time period [5,10).
- At time 6, all three rooms are being used. The fifth meeting is delayed.
- At time 10, the meetings in rooms 1 and 2 finish. The fifth meeting starts in room 1 for the time period [10,12).
Room 0 held 1 meeting while rooms 1 and 2 each held 2 meetings, so we return 1.

```java

    public int mostBooked(int n, int[][] meetings) {
        Arrays.sort(meetings, (a, b) -> a[0] - b[0]);
        int[] counter = new int[n];
        PriorityQueue<Integer> available = new PriorityQueue<>();

        // index of room, end time
        PriorityQueue<int[]> busy = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> a[1] == b[1] ? a[0] - b[0] : a[1] - b[1]);
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            available.offer(i);
        }

        for(int[] meeting : meetings) {
            int start = meeting[0], end = meeting[1];

            while(!busy.isEmpty() && start >= busy.peek()[1]) {
                available.offer(busy.poll()[0]);
            }

            if(!available.isEmpty()) {
                int room = available.poll();
                counter[room]++;
                busy.offer(new int[] {room, end});
            } else {
                int[] current = busy.poll();
                int room = current[0], currentEnd = current[1];
                counter[room]++;
                busy.offer(new int[]{room, end + currentEnd - start});
            }
        }

        int maxRoomIdx = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if(counter[maxRoomIdx] < counter[i]) {
                maxRoomIdx = i;
            }
        }

        return maxRoomIdx;
