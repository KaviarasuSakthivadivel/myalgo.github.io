You are given an `m x n` binary matrix `mat` of `1`'s (representing soldiers) and `0`'s (representing civilians). The soldiers are positioned **in front** of the civilians. That is, all the `1`'s will appear to the **left** of all the `0`'s in each row.

A row `i` is **weaker** than a row `j` if one of the following is true:

- The number of soldiers in row `i` is less than the number of soldiers in row `j`.
- Both rows have the same number of soldiers and `i < j`.

Return _the indices of the_ `k` _**weakest** rows in the matrix ordered from weakest to strongest_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** mat = 
[[1,1,0,0,0],
 [1,1,1,1,0],
 [1,0,0,0,0],
 [1,1,0,0,0],
 [1,1,1,1,1]], 
k = 3
**Output:** [2,0,3]
**Explanation:** 
The number of soldiers in each row is: 
- Row 0: 2 
- Row 1: 4 
- Row 2: 1 
- Row 3: 2 
- Row 4: 5 
The rows ordered from weakest to strongest are [2,0,3,1,4].

**Example 2:**

**Input:** mat = 
[[1,0,0,0],
 [1,1,1,1],
 [1,0,0,0],
 [1,0,0,0]], 
k = 2
**Output:** [0,2]
**Explanation:** 
The number of soldiers in each row is: 
- Row 0: 1 
- Row 1: 4 
- Row 2: 1 
- Row 3: 1 
The rows ordered from weakest to strongest are [0,2,3,1].

#### Approach 3: Binary Search and Sorting/ Map

**Intuition**

This approach uses **Binary Search**. If you're not familiar with this algorithm, have a look at the [Explore Module on Binary Search](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/binary-search/) and do the first couple of problems.

The way that we calculated the "strength" of each row wasn't very efficient. What we used above was _linear search_, because it scanned through the row until it encountered a 0 (and if the row had been all 1's, it would have had to check the entire row!). Instead, we could find the index of the _first_ `0` in each row, and use this to calculate the "strength".

So, let's think through how we could implement a _binary search_ to find the first `0` in a given row.

Recall that _binary search_ starts by looking at the middle element. It then decides which half of the array the "target" element (in this case the first 0 in the row) must be in and repeats the same process on that half until there's only one element left in the search space.

For example, here is the middle of a really long row. Which half of the array is the "target" in?

![[binary_search_example_1.png]]

What about this one? You can't actually see the target element, but it's possible to know which half it's in.

![[binary_search_example_2.png]]

And what about this one?

![[binary_search_example_3.png]]

If the current "middle" element is a `0`, we know we've gone too far and the solution must be to the left. And if the current "middle" element is a `1`, then we know we haven't gone far enough, and the solution is to the right.

Here's the pseudocode for the binary search algorithm.

```kotlin
low = 0
high = n
while low < high:
    mid = low + (high - low) // 2
    if row[mid] == 1:
        low = mid + 1
    else:
        high = mid
return low
```

```java
class Solution {
    public int binarySearch(int[] arr) {
        int low = 0, high = arr.length;
        
        while(low < high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            if(arr[mid] == 1) {
                low = mid + 1;
            } else {
                high = mid;
            }
        }
        
        return low;
    }
    
    public int[] kWeakestRows(int[][] mat, int k) {
        // Strength, index
        PriorityQueue<int[]> pQueue = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> {
           if(a[0] == b[0]) {
               return b[1] - a[1];
           } else {
               return b[0] - a[0];
           }
        });
        
        for(int i = 0; i < mat.length; i++) {
            int strength = binarySearch(mat[i]);
            pQueue.add(new int[]{strength, i});
            if(pQueue.size() > k) {
                pQueue.poll();
            }
        }
        
        int[] result = new int[k];
        for(int i = k - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            result[i] = pQueue.poll()[1];
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```
