Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _**the vertical order traversal** of its nodes' values_. (i.e., from top to bottom, column by column).

If two nodes are in the same row and column, the order should be from **left to right**.

## Solution


#### Overview

This is yet another problem about Binary Tree traversals. As one would probably know, the common strategies to traverse a _Tree_ data structure are **_Breadth-First Search_** (_a.k.a_ BFS) and **_Depth-First Search_** (_a.k.a._ DFS).

The DFS strategy can be further distinguished as _preorder DFS_, _inorder DFS_ and _postorder DFS_, depending on the relative order of visit among the node itself and its child nodes.

If one is not familiar with the concepts of BFS and DFS, one can find the corresponding problems on LeetCode to practice with. Also, we have an Explore card called [Queue & Stack](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/queue-stack/) where we cover both [the BFS traversal](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/queue-stack/231/practical-application-queue/) as well as [the DFS traversal](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/queue-stack/232/practical-application-stack/).  
Hence, in this article, we won't repeat ourselves on these concepts.

In the problem description, we are asked to return the **_vertical_** order of a binary tree, which actually implies two sub-orders, where each node would have a 2-dimensional index (denoted as `<column, row>`)

![[314_coordinates.png]]

- **column-wise order**  
      
    
    If we look at a binary tree _horizontally_, each node can be aligned to a specific `column`, based on its relative _offset_ to the root node of the tree.  
      
    
    Let us assume that the root node has a column index of `0`, then its left child node would have a column index of `-1` and its right child node would have a column index of `+1`, and so on.  
      
    
- **row-wise order**  
      
      
    Now if we put the nodes into a _vertical_ dimension, each node would be assigned to a specific `row`, based on its _level_ (_i.e._ the vertical distance to the root node).  
      
    
    Let us assume that the root node has a row index of `0`, then both its child nodes would have the row index of `1`.
    

> Given the above definitions, we can now formulate the problem as a task to order the nodes based on the 2-dimensional coordinates that we defined above.

More specifically, the nodes should be ordered by `column` first, and further the nodes on the same column should be ordered _**vertically**_ based on their `row` indices.

#### Approach 1: Breadth-First Search (BFS)

**Intuition**

With the formulation of the problem in the overview section, one of the most intuitive solutions to tackle the problem would be applying the BFS traversal, where the nodes would be visited _level by level_.

With the BFS traversal, we naturally can guarantee the vertical order of the visits, _i.e._ the nodes at _higher_ levels (large `row` values) would get visited later than the ones at lower levels.

However, we are still missing the horizontal order ( the `column` order). To ensure this order, we need to do some additional processing during the BFS traversal.

> The idea is that we keep a hash table (let's denote it as `columnTable<key, value>`), where we keep the node values grouped by the `column` index.

The `key` in the hash table would be the `column` index, and the corresponding `value` would be a list which contains the values of all the nodes that share the same column index.

In addition, the values in the corresponding list should be ordered by their `row` indices, which would be guaranteed by the BFS traversal as we mentioned before.

**Algorithm**

We elaborate on the steps to implement the above idea.

- First, we create a hash table named `columnTable` to keep track of the results.
    
      
    
- As to the BFS traversal, a common code pattern would be to use a `queue` data structure to keep track of the order we need to visit nodes.  
    We initialize the queue by putting the root node along with its column index value (`0`).
    
      
    
- We then run the BFS traversal with a loop consuming the elements from the queue.
    
      
    
- At each iteration within the BFS, we pop out an element from the queue. The element consists of a `node` and its corresponding `column` index. If the node is not empty, we then populate the `columnTable` with the value of the node. Subsequently, we then put its child nodes along with their respective column indices (_i.e._ `column-1` and `column+1`) into the queue.
    
      
    
- At the end of the BFS traversal, we obtain a hash table that contains the desired node values grouped by their `column` indices. For each group of values, they are further ordered by their `row` indices.
    
      
    
- We then sort the hash table by its keys, _i.e._ `column` index in ascending order. And finally we return the results _column by column_.
