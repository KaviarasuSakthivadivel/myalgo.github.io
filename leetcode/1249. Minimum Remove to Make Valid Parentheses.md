Given a string s of `'('` , `')'` and lowercase English characters.

Your task is to remove the minimum number of parentheses ( `'('` or `')'`, in any positions ) so that the resulting _parentheses string_ is valid and return **any** valid string.

Formally, a _parentheses string_ is valid if and only if:

- It is the empty string, contains only lowercase characters, or
- It can be written as `AB` (`A` concatenated with `B`), where `A` and `B` are valid strings, or
- It can be written as `(A)`, where `A` is a valid string.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "lee(t(c)o)de)"
**Output:** "lee(t(c)o)de"
**Explanation:** "lee(t(co)de)" , "lee(t(c)ode)" would also be accepted.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "a)b(c)d"
**Output:** "ab(c)d"

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s = "))(("
**Output:** ""
**Explanation:** An empty string is also valid.

#### Approach 1: Using a Stack and String Builder

**Intuition**

Let's start by looking at what it means for the parentheses of a string to be _valid_.

The parentheses in a string are balanced _if and only if_ these 2 conditions are met:

1. There are the same number of `"("` and `")"` in the string.
2. Scanning through the string from left to right and counting how many `"("` and `")"` there are so far, there should never be a time where there are _more_ `")"` than `"("`. We call `count("(") - count(")")` the _balance_ of the string..

Here's a simple pseudocode algorithm that checks for these conditions by scanning through the string and incrementing `balance` each time it sees a `"("`, and decrementing each time it sees `")"`. If at any point the balance is negative, which can only happen if we've seen more `")"` than `"("`, then it returns `false`. If we get to the end, then it returns `true` only if the balance is `0`, which means we've seen the same number of `"("` as `")"`.

```csharp
function is_balanced_parentheses(string)
    balance = 0
    for each char in the string
        if char == "("
            balance = balance + 1
        if char == ")"
            balance = balance - 1
        if balance < 0
            return false
    return balance == 0
```

For example, `"L(ee)(t(()co)d)e"` is a _balanced_ string. We'll use a table to show how the balance changes at each point in the string.

![[balance_example_1.png]]

The string `"L(e)e(t)c)o)(d)e"` is invalid because the _balance goes negative_.

![[balance_example_2.png]]

And the string `"L(e)e(t()c(o(d)e"` is invalid because the balance _is not 0 at the end_.

![[balance_example_3.png]]

The question asks us to remove the _**minimum number of parentheses**_ to make the string valid. So, how can we use the tricks above to achieve this? For starters, we know we'll need to remove any `")"` that we encountered when balance was already 0. It would be impossible to remove less `")"`, because there are not enough `"("` before them.

Taking the 2nd example from above, here's what we get when we delete `")"` that would have made the balance go negative.

![[balance_example_4.png]]

Because we now finish with a zero balance, we know the string is valid.

However, this isn't the full solution. Take a look at this example where we have removed any `")"` from `"L(e)))et((co)d(e"` that would have caused a negative balance, but we still _end with a non-zero balance_.

![[balance_example_5.png]]

A non-zero balance at the end occurs when there were `"("` that were not closed with a `")"`. Clearly, we'll need to remove some `"("` to reduce the balance at the end down to 0. But which should we remove? What will happen if we choose 2 random ones?

Here is the string from above. The 2 `"("` we have randomly chosen to remove have been crossed out (along with the 2 `")"` from before) and we've checked the balance of the new string.![[balance_example_6.png]]

We've caused the balance to go negative while checking again. Even though we have the same number of `"("` and `")"` in the string, they don't match up. The last `")"` is _before_ the last `"("`. We don't want to do another round of removing `")"`, because that would no longer be optimal. We need to identify which `"("` each of our `")"` is actually pairing with. Here is the example with a different color to show each pair. A `")"` always pairs with the _closest_ `"("` that doesn't already have a pair.

![[balance_example_7.png]]

The 2 `"("` that don't pair with a `")"` are the ones we should remove. This way, we know we won't cause a negative balance.

So, remembering that each `")"` was paired with the _closest_ `"("` that isn't already paired, how could we do this in code? We need to know the indexes of the problematic `"("`.

We can use a **stack**. Each time we see a `"("`, we should add its index to the stack. Each time we see a `")"`, we should remove an index from the stack because the `")"` will match with whatever `"("` was at the top of the stack. The _length of the stack_ is equivalent to the `balance` from above. We will need to do the:

1. Remove a `")"` if it is encountered when stack was already empty (prevent negative balance).
2. Remove a `"("` if it is left on stack at end (prevent non-zero final balance).


### Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public String minRemoveToMakeValid(String s) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(s);
        Stack<Integer>  stack = new Stack<>();
        for(int i = 0 ; i < s.length() ; i++) {
            Character ch = s.charAt(i);
            if(ch.equals('(')) {
                stack.push(i);
            } else if(ch.equals(')')){
                if(stack.empty()) {
                    sb.setCharAt(i, '*');
                } else {
                    stack.pop();
                }
            }
        }
        
        while (!stack.empty()) {
            sb.setCharAt(stack.pop(), '*');                
        }
        
        return sb.toString().replaceAll("\\*", "");
            
    }
}
```
