Given an integer array `arr` and an integer `difference`, return the length of the longest subsequence in `arr` which is an arithmetic sequence such that the difference between adjacent elements in the subsequence equals `difference`.

A **subsequence** is a sequence that can be derived from `arr` by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** arr = [1,2,3,4], difference = 1
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** The longest arithmetic subsequence is [1,2,3,4].

**Example 2:**

**Input:** arr = [1,3,5,7], difference = 1
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** The longest arithmetic subsequence is any single element.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** arr = [1,5,7,8,5,3,4,2,1], difference = -2
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** The longest arithmetic subsequence is [7,5,3,1].


```java
class Solution {

    public int longestSubsequence(int[] arr, int difference) {
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> dp = new HashMap<>();
        int globalMax = 1;

        for(int num : arr) {
            int length = dp.getOrDefault(num - difference, 0) + 1;

            dp.put(num, length);
            globalMax = Math.max(globalMax, length);
        }

        return globalMax;
    }

    public int longestSubsequenceTLE(int[] arr, int difference) {
        int globalMax = 1;

        for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            int currentNum = arr[i];
            int maxLength = 1;
            for(int j = i + 1; j < arr.length; j++) {
                if(arr[j] - currentNum == difference) {
                    currentNum = arr[j];
                    maxLength++;
                }
            }

            globalMax = Math.max(globalMax, maxLength);
        }

        return globalMax;
    }
}
```


### Wrong method
```java
public class LongestArithmeticSubsequence {
    public static int longestSubsequence(int[] arr, int difference) {
        int maxLength = 0;
        int n = arr.length;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int currentNum = arr[i];
            int currentLength = 1;

            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                if (arr[j] - arr[j - 1] == difference) {
                    currentLength++;
                }
            }

            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, currentLength);
        }

        return maxLength;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {1, 2, 3, 4};
        int difference = 1;
        int result = longestSubsequence(arr, difference);
        System.out.println(result);  // Output: 4
    }
}
```

Upon reviewing the code, I realized that there was an error in the brute force method implementation. The issue was that we were only checking the difference between adjacent elements in the inner loop, which is not sufficient for finding the longest arithmetic subsequence.

To solve this problem, we need to modify the brute force approach to consider all possible subsequences, not just adjacent elements. This can be achieved by using nested loops to compare each element with all subsequent elements in the array.

```java
public class LongestArithmeticSubsequence {
    public static int longestSubsequence(int[] arr, int difference) {
        int maxLength = 0;
        int n = arr.length;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int currentNum = arr[i];
            int currentLength = 1;

            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                int nextNum = arr[j];
                if (nextNum - currentNum == difference) {
                    currentNum = nextNum;
                    currentLength++;
                }
            }

            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, currentLength);
        }

        return maxLength;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {1, 5, 7, 8, 5, 3, 4, 2, 1};
        int difference = -2;
        int result = longestSubsequence(arr, difference);
        System.out.println(result);  // Output: 4
    }
}
```

In the corrected version, we compare each element `currentNum` with all subsequent elements `nextNum` to check if the difference between them is equal to the required difference. If it is, we increment the `currentLength` variable.

**In summary, the first method fails to find the longest arithmetic subsequence because it only considers adjacent elements, while the second method succeeds by keeping track of the most recent element that satisfies the required difference. This allows the second method to handle cases where there are gaps between the elements of the subsequence.**


Let's go through the example of the array `[1, 5, 7, 8, 5, 3, 4, 2, 1]` with a difference of `-2` to understand why the first method fails and why the second method works.

1. The second method also iterates over each element of the array, starting with the first element `1`.
    
2. It initializes `currentNum` as the starting element (`currentNum = 1`) and `maxLength` as `1`.
    
3. The inner loop checks the difference between the current element and `currentNum`. Starting from the second element `5`, the difference is `5 - 1 = 4`, which doesn't match the required difference of `-2`. Hence, it is not included in the subsequence, and `maxLength` remains `1`.
    
4. The inner loop continues for the subsequent elements. When it reaches the element `7`, the difference (`7 - 5 = 2`) matches the required difference (`-2`). Therefore, `7` is included in the subsequence, and both `currentNum` and `maxLength` are updated.
    
5. The inner loop continues for the remaining elements, and the differences between adjacent elements (`8 - 7`, `5 - 8`, `3 - 5`, etc.) match the required difference. Consequently, the subsequence `[7, 5, 3, 1]` is found, and `maxLength` is updated to `4`.
    
6. After the inner loop ends, the maximum length (`maxLength`) is compared with the global maximum (`globalMax`). In this case, `maxLength` is greater, so `globalMax` is updated to `4`.
    
7. The second method continues to iterate over all elements of the array, and it successfully finds the longest arithmetic subsequence with the required difference, which is `[7, 5, 3, 1]`. Therefore, it returns the global maximum length, which is `4`.
    

The key difference between the two methods lies in how the previous element is handled. In the first method, the previous element is directly accessed using `arr[j - 1]`, while in the second method, the previous element is stored and updated in the `currentNum` variable. This enables the second method to correctly handle cases where the arithmetic subsequence has gaps between its elements.
