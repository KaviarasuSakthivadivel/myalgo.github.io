In this problem, a tree is an **undirected graph** that is connected and has no cycles.

You are given a graph that started as a tree with `n` nodes labeled from `1` to `n`, with one additional edge added. The added edge has two **different** vertices chosen from `1` to `n`, and was not an edge that already existed. The graph is represented as an array `edges` of length `n` where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `ai` and `bi` in the graph.

Return _an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a tree of_ `n` _nodes_. If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in the input.

**Input:** edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]
**Output:** [2,3]

## Solution

If we are familiar with a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure, we can use this in a straightforward manner to solve the problem: we simply find the first edge occurring in the graph that is already connected. The rest of this explanation will focus on the details of implementing DSU.

A DSU data structure can be used to maintain knowledge of the connected components of a graph, and query for them quickly. In particular, we would like to support two operations:

- `dsu.find(node x)`, which outputs a unique id so that two nodes have the same id if and only if they are in the same connected component, and:
    
- `dsu.union(node x, node y)`, which draws an edge `(x, y)` in the graph, connecting the components with id `find(x)` and `find(y)` together.
    

To achieve this, we keep track of `parent`, which remembers the `id` of a smaller node in the same connected component. If the node is it's own parent, we call this the _leader_ of that connected component.

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] findRedundantConnection(int[][] edges) {
        UnionFind uFind = new UnionFind(1001);

        for(int[] edge : edges) {
            if(!uFind.union(edge[0], edge[1])) {
                return edge;
            }
        }

        throw new AssertionError();
    }
}

class UnionFind {
    private int[] parent;
    private int[] rank;
    private int size;

    public UnionFind(int n) {
        size = n;
        parent = new int[n];
        rank = new int[n];

        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            parent[i] = i;
            rank[i] = 1;
        }
    }

    public int find(int x) {
        if(parent[x] == x) {
            return x;
        }

        return parent[x] = find(parent[x]);
    }

    public boolean union(int x, int y) {
        int xRoot = find(x);
        int yRoot = find(y);

        if(xRoot == yRoot) {
            return false;
        }

        if(rank[xRoot] > rank[yRoot]) {
            parent[yRoot] = xRoot;
        } else if(rank[xRoot] < rank[yRoot]) {
            parent[xRoot] = yRoot;
        } else {
            parent[xRoot] = yRoot;
            rank[yRoot] += 1;
        }

        return true;
    }

    public boolean areConnected(int x, int y) {
        return find(x) == find(y);
    }
}
