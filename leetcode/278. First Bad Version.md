You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

Suppose you have `n` versions `[1, 2, ..., n]` and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API `bool isBadVersion(version)` which returns whether `version` is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 5, bad = 4
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:**
call isBadVersion(3) -> false
call isBadVersion(5) -> true
call isBadVersion(4) -> true
Then 4 is the first bad version.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 1, bad = 1
**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= bad <= n <= 231 - 1`

### Solution

#### Approach #2 (Binary Search) [Accepted]

It is not difficult to see that this could be solved using a classic algorithm - Binary search. Let us see how the search space could be halved each time below.

```dart
Scenario #1: isBadVersion(mid) => false

 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
 G G G G G G B B B       G = Good, B = Bad
 |       |       |
left    mid    right
```

Let us look at the first scenario above where is `BadVersion(mid)⇒falseisBadVersion(mid)`. We know that all versions preceding and including `mid` are all good. So we set `left=mid+1` to indicate that the new search space is the interval [mid + 1, right][mid+1,right] (inclusive).

```dart
Scenario #2: isBadVersion(mid) => true

 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
 G G G B B B B B B       G = Good, B = Bad
 |       |       |
left    mid    right
```

The only scenario left is where isBadVersion(mid)⇒true. This tells us that midmidmid may or may not be the first bad version, but we can tell for sure that all versions after midmidmid can be discarded. Therefore we set right=midright = midright=mid as the new search space of interval [left,mid] (inclusive).

```java
/* The isBadVersion API is defined in the parent class VersionControl.
      boolean isBadVersion(int version); */

public class Solution extends VersionControl {
    public int firstBadVersion(int n) {
        int left = 1;
        int right = n;
        
        while(left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if(isBadVersion(mid)) {
                right = mid;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }            
        }
        return left;
    }
}
```
