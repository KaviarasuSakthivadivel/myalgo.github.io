You are given a series of video clips from a sporting event that lasted `time` seconds. These video clips can be overlapping with each other and have varying lengths.

Each video clip is described by an array `clips` where `clips[i] = [starti, endi]` indicates that the ith clip started at `starti` and ended at `endi`.

We can cut these clips into segments freely.

- For example, a clip `[0, 7]` can be cut into segments `[0, 1] + [1, 3] + [3, 7]`.

Return _the minimum number of clips needed so that we can cut the clips into segments that cover the entire sporting event_ `[0, time]`. If the task is impossible, return `-1`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** clips = [[0,2],[4,6],[8,10],[1,9],[1,5],[5,9]], time = 10
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** We take the clips [0,2], [8,10], [1,9]; a total of 3 clips.
Then, we can reconstruct the sporting event as follows:
We cut [1,9] into segments [1,2] + [2,8] + [8,9].
Now we have segments [0,2] + [2,8] + [8,10] which cover the sporting event [0, 10].

**Example 2:**

**Input:** clips = [[0,1],[1,2]], time = 5
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:** We cannot cover [0,5] with only [0,1] and [1,2].

**Example 3:**

**Input:** clips = [[0,1],[6,8],[0,2],[5,6],[0,4],[0,3],[6,7],[1,3],[4,7],[1,4],[2,5],[2,6],[3,4],[4,5],[5,7],[6,9]], time = 9
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** We can take clips [0,4], [4,7], and [6,9].


## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int videoStitching(int[][] clips, int time) {
        Arrays.sort(clips, (a, b) -> a[0] - b[0]);

        int n = clips.length;
        int end = 0, minClips = 0, i = 0, farthest = 0;
        while(end < time) {
            while(i < n && clips[i][0] <= end) {
                farthest = Math.max(farthest, clips[i++][1]);
            }

            if(farthest <= end) {
                return -1;
            }

            end = farthest;
            minClips++;
        }
        return minClips;
    }
}
