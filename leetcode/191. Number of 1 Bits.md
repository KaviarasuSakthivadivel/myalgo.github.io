Write a function that takes the binary representation of an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the [Hamming weight](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_weight)).

**Note:**

- Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, the input will be given as a signed integer type. It should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.
- In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using [2's complement notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement). Therefore, in **Example 3**, the input represents the signed integer. `-3`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 00000000000000000000000000001011
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** The input binary string **00000000000000000000000000001011** has a total of three '1' bits.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 00000000000000000000000010000000
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** The input binary string **00000000000000000000000010000000** has a total of one '1' bit.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 11111111111111111111111111111101
**Output:** 31
**Explanation:** The input binary string **11111111111111111111111111111101** has a total of thirty one '1' bits.

**Constraints:**

- The input must be a **binary string** of length `32`.

**Follow up:** If this function is called many times, how would you optimize it?



## Solution

#### Approach 1: Loop and Flip

```java
public class Solution {
    // you need to treat n as an unsigned value
    public int hammingWeight(int n) {
        int mask = 1;
        int bits = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
            if((n & mask) != 0) {
                bits++;
            }
            
            mask <<= 1;
        }
        
        return bits;
    }
}
```

#### Approach 2: Bit Manipulation

**Algorithm**

We can make the previous algorithm simpler and a little faster. Instead of checking every bit of the number, we repeatedly flip the least-significant 1-bit of the number to 0, and add 1 to the sum. As soon as the number becomes 0, we know that it does not have any more 1-bits, and we return the sum.

```java
public int hammingWeight(int n) {
    int sum = 0;
    while (n != 0) {
        sum++;
        n &= (n - 1);
    }
    return sum;
}
```
