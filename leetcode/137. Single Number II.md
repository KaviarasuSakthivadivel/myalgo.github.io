Given an integer array `nums` where every element appears **three times** except for one, which appears **exactly once**. _Find the single element and return it_.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [2,2,3,2]
**Output:** 3

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]
**Output:** 99

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104`
- `-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1`
- Each element in `nums` appears exactly **three times** except for one element which appears **once**.

## Solution

```java
    
    // The usual bit manipulation code is bit hard to get and replicate. I like to think about the number 
    // in 32 bits and just count how many 1s are there in each bit, and sum %= 3 will clear it once it 
    // reaches 3. 
    
    
    //After running for all the numbers for each bit, if we have a 1, then that 1 belongs to 
    // the single number, we can simply move it back to its spot by doing loner |= lonerBit << shift;

    //This has complexity of O(32n), which is essentially O(n) and very easy to think and implement. Plus, 
    // you get a general solution for any times of occurrence. Say all the numbers have 5 times, just do  
    // sum %= 5.
    
    
class Solution {
    public int singleNumber(int[] nums) {

        // Loner
        int loner = 0;

        // Iterate over all bits
        for (int shift = 0; shift < 32; shift++) {
            int bitSum = 0;

            // For this bit, iterate over all integers
            for (int num : nums) {
                // Compute the bit of num, and add it to bitSum
                int bit = num >> shift;
                
                if((bit & 1) == 1) {
                    bitSum++;
                }
            }

            // Compute the bit of loner and place it
            int lonerBit = bitSum % 3;
            loner = loner | (lonerBit << shift);
        }
        return loner;
    }
}
```
