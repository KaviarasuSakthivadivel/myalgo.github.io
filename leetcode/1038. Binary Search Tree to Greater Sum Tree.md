Given the `root` of a Binary Search Tree (BST), convert it to a Greater Tree such that every key of the original BST is changed to the original key plus the sum of all keys greater than the original key in BST.

As a reminder, a _binary search tree_ is a tree that satisfies these constraints:

- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **less than** the node's key.
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **greater than** the node's key.
- Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
**Example 1:**
![[tree_1038.png]]

**Input:** root = [4,1,6,0,2,5,7,null,null,null,3,null,null,null,8]
**Output:** [30,36,21,36,35,26,15,null,null,null,33,null,null,null,8]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root = [0,null,1]
**Output:** [1,null,1]

## Solution

```java
class Solution {

    private TreeNode getSuccessor(TreeNode current) {
        TreeNode succ = current.right;

        while(succ.left != null && succ.left != current) {
            succ = succ.left;
        }

        return succ;
    }

    public TreeNode bstToGst(TreeNode root) {
        int sum = 0;
        TreeNode current = root;
        while(current != null) {
            if(current.right == null) { // No successor can be found
                sum += current.val;
                current.val = sum;
                current = current.left;
            } else {
                TreeNode successor = getSuccessor(current);
                if(successor.left == null) {
                    successor.left = current;
                    current = current.right;
                } else {
                    successor.left = null;
                    sum += current.val;
                    current.val = sum;
                    current = current.left;
                }
            }
        }
        return root;
    }
}
```

#### Approach #3 Reverse Morris In-order Traversal [Accepted]

**Intuition**

There is a clever way to perform an in-order traversal using only linear time  
and constant space, first described by J. H. Morris in his 1979 paper  
"Traversing Binary Trees Simply and Cheaply". In general, the recursive and  
iterative stack methods sacrifice linear space for the ability to return to a  
node after visiting its left subtree. The Morris traversal instead exploits  
the unused `null` pointer(s) of the tree's leaves to create a temporary link  
out of the left subtree, allowing the traversal to be performed using only  
constant additional memory. To apply it to this problem, we can simply swap  
all "left" and "right" references, which will reverse the traversal.

**Algorithm**

First, we initialize `node`, which points to the root. Then, until `node`  
points to `null` (specifically, the left `null` of the tree's minimum-value  
node), we repeat the following. First, consider whether the current node has  
a right subtree. If it does not have a right subtree, then there is no  
unvisited node with a greater value, so we can visit this node and move into  
the left subtree. If it does have a right subtree, then there is at least one  
unvisited node with a greater value, and thus we must visit first go to the  
right subtree. To do so, we obtain a reference to the in-order successor (the  
smallest-value node larger than the current) via our helper function  
`getSuccessor`. This successor node is the node that must be visited  
immediately before the current node, so it by definition has a `null` `left`  
pointer (otherwise it would not be the successor). Therefore, when we first  
find a node's successor, we temporarily link it (via its `left` pointer) to  
the node and proceed to the node's right subtree. Then, when we finish  
visiting the right subtree, the leftmost `left` pointer in it will be our  
temporary link that we can use to escape the subtree. After following this  
link, we have returned to the original node that we previously passed  
through, but did not visit. This time, when we find that the successor's  
`left` pointer loops back to the current node, we know that we have visited  
the entire right subtree, so we can now erase the temporary link and move  
into the left subtree.

The figure above shows an example of the modified tree during a reverse  
Morris traversal. Left pointers are illustrated in blue and right pointers in  
red. Dashed edges indicate temporary links generated at some point during the  
algorithm (which will be erased before it terminates). Notice that blue edges  
can be dashed, as we always exploit the empty `left` pointer of successor  
nodes. Additionally, notice that every node with a right subtree has a link  
from its in-order successor.


### Solution - Recursive

```java
	public TreeNode convertBST(TreeNode root) {
        
        if(root != null) {
            convertBST(root.right);
            
            sum += root.val;
            root.val = sum;
            
            convertBST(root.left);
        }
        
        return root;
    }
```
