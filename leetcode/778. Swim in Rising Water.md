You are given an `n x n` integer matrix `grid` where each value `grid[i][j]` represents the elevation at that point `(i, j)`.

The rain starts to fall. At time `t`, the depth of the water everywhere is `t`. You can swim from a square to another 4-directionally adjacent square if and only if the elevation of both squares individually are at most `t`. You can swim infinite distances in zero time. Of course, you must stay within the boundaries of the grid during your swim.

Return _the least time until you can reach the bottom right square_ `(n - 1, n - 1)` _if you start at the top left square_ `(0, 0)`.

**Example 1:**

![[swim1-grid-778.jpeg]]

**Input:** grid = [[0,2],[1,3]]
**Output:** 3
Explanation:
At time 0, you are in grid location (0, 0).
You cannot go anywhere else because 4-directionally adjacent neighbors have a higher elevation than t = 0.
You cannot reach point (1, 1) until time 3.
When the depth of water is 3, we can swim anywhere inside the grid.

**Example 2:**

![[swim2-grid-1_778.jpeg]]

**Input:** grid = [[0,1,2,3,4],[24,23,22,21,5],[12,13,14,15,16],[11,17,18,19,20],[10,9,8,7,6]]
**Output:** 16
**Explanation:** The final route is shown.
We need to wait until time 16 so that (0, 0) and (4, 4) are connected.

**Constraints:**

- `n == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= n <= 50`
- `0 <= grid[i][j] < n2`
- Each value `grid[i][j]` is **unique**.

```java
class Solution {
    public int swimInWater(int[][] grid) {
        int n = grid.length;
        PriorityQueue<int[]> pq = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> a[0] - b[0]);
        pq.offer(new int[]{grid[0][0], 0, 0});

        boolean[][] seen = new boolean[n][n];
        seen[0][0] = true;
        int result = 0;

        int[] directions = new int[]{0, 1, 0, -1, 0};

        while(!pq.isEmpty()) {
            int[] nodeData = pq.poll();

            int weight = nodeData[0], row = nodeData[1], col = nodeData[2];
            result = Math.max(result, weight);

            if(row == n -  1 && col == n - 1) {
                break;
            }

            for(int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
                int r = directions[i] + row;
                int c = directions[i + 1] + col;

                if(r < 0 || c < 0 || r >= n || c >= n || seen[r][c]) {
                    continue;
                }

                pq.offer(new int[]{grid[r][c], r, c});
                seen[r][c] = true;
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
}
