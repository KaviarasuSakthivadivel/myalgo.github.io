Given a characters array `tasks`, representing the tasks a CPU needs to do, where each letter represents a different task. Tasks could be done in any order. Each task is done in one unit of time. For each unit of time, the CPU could complete either one task or just be idle.

However, there is a non-negative integer `n` that represents the cooldown period between two **same tasks** (the same letter in the array), that is that there must be at least `n` units of time between any two same tasks.

Return _the least number of units of times that the CPU will take to finish all the given tasks_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2
**Output:** 8
**Explanation:** 
A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B
There is at least 2 units of time between any two same tasks.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 0
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** On this case any permutation of size 6 would work since n = 0.
["A","A","A","B","B","B"]
["A","B","A","B","A","B"]
["B","B","B","A","A","A"]
...
And so on.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** tasks = ["A","A","A","A","A","A","B","C","D","E","F","G"], n = 2
**Output:** 16
**Explanation:** 
One possible solution is
A -> B -> C -> A -> D -> E -> A -> F -> G -> A -> idle -> idle -> A -> idle -> idle -> A

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= task.length <= 104`
- `tasks[i]` is upper-case English letter.
- The integer `n` is in the range `[0, 100]`.

#### Overview

We're asked to execute all the tasks in the input array.  
The main problem is the presence of cooling interval between  
the same tasks.

#### Approach 1: Greedy

**Intuition**

The total number of CPU intervals we need consists of busy and idle slots.  
Number of busy slots is defined by the number of tasks to execute:  
`len(tasks)`. The problem is to compute a number of idle slots.

Maximum possible number of idle slots is defined by the  
frequency of the most frequent task: `idle_time <= (f_max - 1) * n`.

![[idle_621.png]]

This maximum could be decreased because one  
doesn't need to keep the CPU idle during cooling periods.  
It could execute different tasks as well.

To compute the minimum number of idle slots,  
one could use a greedy strategy.  
The idea is to sort the tasks by frequency in the descending order  
and fulfill as many idle slots as one could.

**Algorithm**

- The maximum number of tasks is 26. Let's allocate an array  
    `frequencies` of 26 elements to keep the frequency of each task.
    
- Iterate over the input array and store the frequency of task A  
    at index 0, the frequency of task B at index 1, etc.
    
- Sort the array and retrieve the maximum frequency `f_max`.  
    This frequency defines the max possible idle time:  
    `idle_time = (f_max - 1) * n`.
    
- Pick the elements in the descending order one by one.  
    At each step, decrease the idle time by `min(f_max - 1, f)` where  
    `f` is a current frequency.  
    Remember, that `idle_time` is greater or equal to 0.
    
- Return busy slots + idle slots: `len(tasks) + idle_time`.

## Solution

```java
class Solution {

    public int leastInterval(char[] tasks, int n) {
        int[] frequencies = new int[26];

        for(char ch : tasks) {
            frequencies[ch - 'A']++;
        }

        Arrays.sort(frequencies);
        int fMax = frequencies[25];
        int idleTime = (fMax - 1) * n;

        for(int i = frequencies.length - 2; i >= 0 && idleTime > 0; i--) {
            idleTime -= Math.min(frequencies[i], fMax - 1);
        }

        return Math.max(0, idleTime) + tasks.length;
    }
}
```
