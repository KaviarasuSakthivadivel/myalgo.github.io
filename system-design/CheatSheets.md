Picking a database is a long-term commitment so the decision shouldn’t be made lightly. The important thing to keep in mind is to choose the right database for the right job.

Data can be structured (SQL), semi-structured (JSON), and unstructured (Blob).

Common DB categories:

🔹 Relational
🔹 Columnar
🔹 Key-value
🔹 In-memory
🔹 Wide column
🔹 Time Series
🔹 Immutable ledger
🔹 Geospatial
🔹 Graph
🔹 Document
🔹 Text search
🔹 Blob
