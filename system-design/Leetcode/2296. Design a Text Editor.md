Design a text editor with a cursor that can do the following:

- **Add** text to where the cursor is.
- **Delete** text from where the cursor is (simulating the backspace key).
- **Move** the cursor either left or right.

When deleting text, only characters to the left of the cursor will be deleted. The cursor will also remain within the actual text and cannot be moved beyond it. More formally, we have that `0 <= cursor.position <= currentText.length` always holds.

Implement the `TextEditor` class:

- `TextEditor()` Initializes the object with empty text.
- `void addText(string text)` Appends `text` to where the cursor is. The cursor ends to the right of `text`.
- `int deleteText(int k)` Deletes `k` characters to the left of the cursor. Returns the number of characters actually deleted.
- `string cursorLeft(int k)` Moves the cursor to the left `k` times. Returns the last `min(10, len)` characters to the left of the cursor, where `len` is the number of characters to the left of the cursor.
- `string cursorRight(int k)` Moves the cursor to the right `k` times. Returns the last `min(10, len)` characters to the left of the cursor, where `len` is the number of characters to the left of the cursor.

**Example 1:**

**Input**
["TextEditor", "addText", "deleteText", "addText", "cursorRight", "cursorLeft", "deleteText", "cursorLeft", "cursorRight"]
[[], ["leetcode"], [4], ["practice"], [3], [8], [10], [2], [6]]
**Output**
[null, null, 4, null, "etpractice", "leet", 4, "", "practi"]

**Explanation**
TextEditor textEditor = new TextEditor(); // The current text is "|". (The '|' character represents the cursor)
textEditor.addText("leetcode"); // The current text is "leetcode|".
textEditor.deleteText(4); // return 4
                          // The current text is "leet|". 
                          // 4 characters were deleted.
textEditor.addText("practice"); // The current text is "leetpractice|". 
textEditor.cursorRight(3); // return "etpractice"
                           // The current text is "leetpractice|". 
                           // The cursor cannot be moved beyond the actual text and thus did not move.
                           // "etpractice" is the last 10 characters to the left of the cursor.
textEditor.cursorLeft(8); // return "leet"
                          // The current text is "leet|practice".
                          // "leet" is the last min(10, 4) = 4 characters to the left of the cursor.
textEditor.deleteText(10); // return 4
                           // The current text is "|practice".
                           // Only 4 characters were deleted.
textEditor.cursorLeft(2); // return ""
                          // The current text is "|practice".
                          // The cursor cannot be moved beyond the actual text and thus did not move. 
                          // "" is the last min(10, 0) = 0 characters to the left of the cursor.
textEditor.cursorRight(6); // return "practi"
                           // The current text is "practi|ce".
                           // "practi" is the last min(10, 6) = 6 characters to the left of the cursor.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= text.length, k <= 40`
- `text` consists of lowercase English letters.
- At most `2 * 104` calls **in total** will be made to `addText`, `deleteText`, `cursorLeft` and `cursorRight`.

**Follow-up:** Could you find a solution with time complexity of `O(k)` per call?


### Thoughts

```java
class TextEditor {
    
    private StringBuilder text;
    private int cursorPosition;

    public TextEditor() {
        text = new StringBuilder();
        cursorPosition = 0;
    }

    public void addText(String textToAdd) {
        text.insert(cursorPosition, textToAdd);
        cursorPosition += textToAdd.length();
    }

    public int deleteText(int k) {
        k = Math.min(k, cursorPosition);
        text.delete(cursorPosition - k, cursorPosition);
        cursorPosition -= k;
        return k;
    }

    public String cursorLeft(int k) {
        k = Math.min(k, cursorPosition);
        cursorPosition -= k;
        return text.substring(Math.max(cursorPosition - 10, 0), cursorPosition);
    }

    public String cursorRight(int k) {
        k = Math.min(k, text.length() - cursorPosition);
        cursorPosition += k;
        return text.substring(cursorPosition - Math.min(cursorPosition, 10), cursorPosition);
    }
}
```


In this implementation:

1. The `TextEditor` class maintains two instance variables: `text` (a `StringBuilder` to store the text) and `cursorPosition` (an integer to track the cursor position).
    
2. The constructor initializes `text` as an empty `StringBuilder` and sets `cursorPosition` to 0.
    
3. The `addText` method takes a `textToAdd` parameter and inserts it at the current `cursorPosition` within the `text` using the `insert` method of `StringBuilder`. The `cursorPosition` is then incremented by the length of the added text.
    
4. The `deleteText` method takes an integer `k` as a parameter. It ensures that `k` is not greater than the `cursorPosition`. It then uses the `delete` method of `StringBuilder` to remove `k` characters to the left of the `cursorPosition`. The `cursorPosition` is decremented by `k`, and the method returns the number of characters actually deleted.
    
5. The `cursorLeft` method takes an integer `k` as a parameter. It ensures that `k` is not greater than the `cursorPosition`. The `cursorPosition` is decremented by `k`, and the method returns a substring of `text` containing the last `min(10, len)` characters to the left of the cursor. Here, `len` is the number of characters to the left of the cursor.
    
6. The `cursorRight` method takes an integer `k` as a parameter. It ensures that `k` is not greater than the number of characters to the right of the cursor (`text.length() - cursorPosition`). The `cursorPosition` is incremented by `k`, and the method returns a substring of `text` containing the last `min(10, len)` characters to the left of the cursor.
    
7. In the `main` method, a `TextEditor` object is created. Text is added using `addText` method, and cursor movements are performed using `cursorLeft` and `cursorRight` methods. The output is printed to demonstrate the functionality.
    

This implementation allows you to use the `TextEditor` class to manipulate text, add or delete characters at the cursor position, and move the cursor left or right within the text.

The time complexity of each method in the `TextEditor` class is as follows:

1. `addText` method: The `addText` method has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the `textToAdd`. It uses the `insert` method of `StringBuilder`, which takes linear time to insert the text at the specified position. Since the position is at the end of the text in this case, the time complexity is O(n).
    
2. `deleteText` method: The `deleteText` method has a time complexity of O(k), where k is the number of characters to be deleted. It uses the `delete` method of `StringBuilder`, which takes linear time to remove the characters from the specified position. The time complexity is determined by the number of characters to be deleted, which is at most equal to the cursor position.
    
3. `cursorLeft` method: The `cursorLeft` method has a time complexity of O(k), where k is the number of times the cursor is moved to the left. It involves decrementing the cursor position by k and returning a substring of the text. Both operations take constant time.
    
4. `cursorRight` method: The `cursorRight` method has a time complexity of O(k), where k is the number of times the cursor is moved to the right. It involves incrementing the cursor position by k and returning a substring of the text. Both operations take constant time.
    

Regarding the efficiency, the provided implementation is reasonably efficient for basic text editing operations. The use of `StringBuilder` allows for efficient manipulation of the text by providing methods for inserting, deleting, and accessing characters in-place. The time complexity for most operations is linear or constant, depending on the specific operation.

However, if the text editing operations need to be performed on extremely large texts or require additional advanced functionalities, other data structures like **rope data structure or gap buffer** might provide better efficiency. These data structures are specifically designed for efficient text editing operations. Implementing such advanced data structures would require more complex code and could be an overkill for typical text editing scenarios. The choice of the data structure depends on the specific requirements and constraints of the application.


## [Java] Two Stacks | With Explanation

### Steps

Keep `left` and `right` stacks which are divided by cursor.

- AddText(): push characters into `left` stack
- deleteText(): pop characters from `left` stack
- cursorRight(): pop characters from `right` stack, then push them to `left` stack
- cursorLeft(): pop characters from `left` stack, then push them to `right` stack

### How to return the left min(10, len) characters?

1. first pop the min(10, len) elements from left stack
2. then push it back so that the left stack remains the same state
3. return the elements as string in reverse order

Refer to `getLeftString()` method

### Complexity

Time Complexity:

- AddText(): `O(n)` where n is text length
- deleteText(): `O(k)`
- cursorRight(): `O(k)`
- cursorLeft(): `O(k)`

Space Complexity:

- `O(m)` where m is total text

### Java

```java
Stack<Character> left = new Stack<>();
Stack<Character> right = new Stack<>();

public void addText(String text) {
	for (int i = 0; i < text.length(); i++) {
		left.push(text.charAt(i));
	}
}

public int deleteText(int k) {
	int cnt = 0;
	while (!left.isEmpty() && k-- > 0) {
		left.pop();
		cnt++;
	}
	return cnt;
}

public String cursorLeft(int k) {
	while (!left.isEmpty() && k-- > 0) {
		right.push(left.pop());
	}
	return getLeftString();
}

public String cursorRight(int k) {
	while (!right.isEmpty() && k-- > 0) {
		left.push(right.pop());
	}
	return getLeftString();
}

String getLeftString() {
	int cnt = 10;
	StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
	while (!left.isEmpty() && cnt-- > 0) {
		sb.append(left.pop());
	}

	for (int i = sb.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
		left.push(sb.charAt(i));
	}
	return sb.reverse().toString();
}
```
