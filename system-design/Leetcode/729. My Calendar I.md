You are implementing a program to use as your calendar. We can add a new event if adding the event will not cause a **double booking**.

A **double booking** happens when two events have some non-empty intersection (i.e., some moment is common to both events.).

The event can be represented as a pair of integers `start` and `end` that represents a booking on the half-open interval `[start, end)`, the range of real numbers `x` such that `start <= x < end`.

Implement the `MyCalendar` class:

- `MyCalendar()` Initializes the calendar object.
- `boolean book(int start, int end)` Returns `true` if the event can be added to the calendar successfully without causing a **double booking**. Otherwise, return `false` and do not add the event to the calendar.

**Example 1:**

**Input**
["MyCalendar", "book", "book", "book"]
[[], [10, 20], [15, 25], [20, 30]]
**Output**
[null, true, false, true]

**Explanation**
MyCalendar myCalendar = new MyCalendar();
myCalendar.book(10, 20); // return True
myCalendar.book(15, 25); // return False, It can not be booked because time 15 is already booked by another event.
myCalendar.book(20, 30); // return True, The event can be booked, as the first event takes every time less than 20, but not including 20.

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= start < end <= 109`
- At most `1000` calls will be made to `book`.

#### Overview

The primary challenge in this problem is to find a proper data structure and an efficient algorithm to maintain all valid events, including **querying** potential conflicting existing events and **inserting** new valid events.

In this solution article, we first start with a straightforward idea of brute force to warm up, then one step forward, we improve the naive approach to keep all existing events in sorted order and reduce the time complexity.

#### Approach #1: Brute Force

**Intuition**

When booking a new event `[start, end)`, check if every current event conflicts with the new event. If none of them do, we can book the event.

**Algorithm**

We will maintain a list of interval _events_ (not necessarily sorted). Evidently, two events `[s1, e1)` and `[s2, e2)` do _not_ conflict if and only if one of them starts after the other one ends: either `e1 <= s2` OR `e2 <= s1`. By De Morgan's laws, this means the events conflict when `s1 < e2` AND `s2 < e1`.

**Implementation**

```java
class MyCalendar {

    List<int[]> bookings;
    
    public MyCalendar() {
        bookings = new ArrayList<>();
    }
    
    public boolean book(int start, int end) {
        
        // Two events (s1, e1) and (s2, e2) are said to conflict when s1 < e2 and s2 < e1
        for(int[] b : bookings) {
            if(b[0] < end && start < b[1]) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        
        bookings.add(new int[]{start, end});
        
        return true;
    }
}
```

# Another method using TreeMap

Booking Process: When the `book` method is called, it checks whether the event with the given start and end times can be booked or not. It does this by finding the previous and next events in the `TreeMap` with respect to the new event's start time. It then verifies that the new event's start time is after the end time of the previous event and before the start time of the next event. If these conditions are met, it means there is no overlap with existing events, and the new event can be booked. Otherwise, the method returns `false`.

```java
class MyCalendar {
    TreeMap<Integer, Integer> calendar;

    MyCalendar() {
        calendar = new TreeMap();
    }

    public boolean book(int start, int end) {
        Integer prev = calendar.floorKey(start),
                next = calendar.ceilingKey(start);
        if ((prev == null || calendar.get(prev) <= start) &&
                (next == null || end <= next)) {
            calendar.put(start, end);
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```
