### DFS 4-directions

```java
int[] dirx = {0, 1, 0, -1};
int[] diry = {-1, 0, 1, 0};

for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
	int r = x + dirx[i];
	int c = y + diry[i];
}
```

## DFS 4-directions 

```java
private int[] DIRECTIONS = new int[]{0, 1, 0, -1, 0}; // New method to calculate the neighbours - 4 directionally

for(int i = 0; i < 4; ++i) {
	int row = curr[0] + DIRECTIONS[i];
	int col = curr[1] + DIRECTIONS[i + 1];
}
```


# DFS and BFS

### Template I - Recursion

---

There are two ways to implement DFS. The first one is to do recursion which you might already be familiar with. Here we provide a template as reference:

```java
/*
 * Return true if there is a path from cur to target.
 */
boolean DFS(Node cur, Node target, Set<Node> visited) {
    return true if cur is target;
    for (next : each neighbor of cur) {
        if (next is not in visited) {
            add next to visited;
            return true if DFS(next, target, visited) == true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

###  DFS - Template II

---

The advantage of the recursion solution is that it is easier to implement. However, there is a huge disadvantage: if the depth of recursion is too high, you will suffer fromÂ `stack overflow`. In that case, you might want to use BFS instead or implement DFS using an explicit stack.

Here we provide a template using an explicit stack:

```java
/*
 * Return true if there is a path from cur to target.
 */
boolean DFS(int root, int target) {
    Set<Node> visited;
    Stack<Node> stack;
    add root to stack;
    while (stack is not empty) {
        Node cur = the top element in stack;
        remove the cur from the stack;
        return true if cur is target;
        for (Node next : the neighbors of cur) {
            if (next is not in visited) {
                add next to visited;
                add next to stack;
            }
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```


### BFS Template I

---

Here we provide a pseudocode for you as a template:

```java
/**
 * Return the length of the shortest path between root and target node.
 */
int BFS(Node root, Node target) {
    Queue<Node> queue;  // store all nodes which are waiting to be processed
    int step = 0;       // number of steps neeeded from root to current node
    // initialize
    add root to queue;
    // BFS
    while (queue is not empty) {
        // iterate the nodes which are already in the queue
        int size = queue.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
            Node cur = the first node in queue;
            return step if cur is target;
            for (Node next : the neighbors of cur) {
                add next to queue;
            }
            remove the first node from queue;
        }
        step = step + 1;
    }
    return -1;          // there is no path from root to target
}
```


### BFS Template II

```java
/**
 * Return the length of the shortest path between root and target node.
 */
int BFS(Node root, Node target) {
    Queue<Node> queue;  // store all nodes which are waiting to be processed
    Set<Node> visited;  // store all the nodes that we've visited
    int step = 0;       // number of steps neeeded from root to current node
    // initialize
    add root to queue;
    add root to visited;
    // BFS
    while (queue is not empty) {
        // iterate the nodes which are already in the queue
        int size = queue.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
            Node cur = the first node in queue;
            return step if cur is target;
            for (Node next : the neighbors of cur) {
                if (next is not in visited) {
                    add next to queue;
                    add next to visited;
                }
            }
            remove the first node from queue;
        }
        step = step + 1;
    }
    return -1;          // there is no path from root to target
}
```
